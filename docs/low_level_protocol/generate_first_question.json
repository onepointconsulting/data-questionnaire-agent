Based on the how fast the data is changing, data can be\\nclassified as static data such as reference data, slowly changing data such as Master Data and slow\\nchanging dimensional data, or volatile data such as time series data and transactional data from Point of\\nSale (POS) systems. Similarly based on the velocity or speed of movement of data or how fast volatile\\ndata is moved from the source to the destination, data can be classified as fast data that includes\\nstreaming data. Streaming data could include social media data or data from IoT sensor data. Big Data\\nrefers to not only large volumes of data but also includes fast data that becomes large volume when\\naccumulated over period of data. Big data includes variety of data including structure, semi-structured\\nand unstructured data. Based on how the data is ageing from the time when the data was generated,\\ndata can be classified as operational data or historical data. Based on how frequently the data is\\nconsumed, data can also be classified as hot, warm, and cold. Often, data within a system in an\\norganization is not exploited for analytics and such data is referred as dark data.\\nModern Data Strategy is no longer limited to Big Data but is agnostic of the type of data and includes\\nANY data whether its fast data or slow data, small data, or big data, transactional, operational, or\\nhistorical data. There is more and more emphasis on including dark data in scope and bringing it to the\\ndata lake. Adoption of LLM for enterprises could hugely benefit from modern data strategy since it\\nincludes consolidation of unstructured data on the data lake.\\n\\nWe live in a data-saturated world. Billions of interconnected devices communicate with countless cloud services. We accumulate data from server log files, GPS networks, security tools, call records, web traffic and more. Every digital transaction, from backend handoffs to the customer\\u2019s fingertips, is catalogued. Everything from the contents of a warehouse\\u2019s shelves to the temperature of our server rooms to the time and location of every login to our secure networks is recorded and stored somewhere. Most of it, today, is unstructured, untagged, untapped. In a word, useless.\\n\\nDark data represents data not collected and therefore not used. Considering that at least 80%\\nof data is dark,it represents the great hidden resource that flows untapped through major\\norganizations. Leveraging dark data in the data integration processes is a challenge as the\\nmost sophisticated data sources\\u2014such as network transactions, IoT, mobility, Wi-Fi, or\\nindustrial networks\\u2014require an advanced engine specially built for the purpose.\\nDark data may be the biggest untapped resource in business today. Dark data, which includes the \\u201cdata exhaust\\u201d generated as a byproduct of our online lives, is all the unknown and untapped data across your organization, generated by systems, devices and interactions. Maybe it\\u2019s siloed off somewhere; maybe the format or metadata is inconsistent. Maybe no one\\u2019s figured out what to do with it. Maybe you literally don\\u2019t know it exists. Most organizations struggle to capitalize on the full potential of their data. A full third of respondents report that more than 75 percent of their organization\\u2019s data is dark. Just 11 percent \\u2014 one in nine \\u2014 report that less than a quarter of their organization\\u2019s data is dark. Inadequate processes, resources and technology hamper the intelligent use of dark data. Neglected by business and IT managers, dark data is an underused asset that demands a more sophisticated approach to how organizations collect, manage and analyze information. Yet respondents also voiced hesitance about diving in. It\\u2019s a challenge, and an opportunity, of surprising scale. Machine data, a major source of dark data, is growing much faster than traditional organizational data, with an accelerating importance to decision making and organizational success. And because dark data can be a powerful fuel for artificial intelligence, organizations that fail to tap its power will also fail to keep up with, much less surpass, their competitors. And competition is global. Organizations must grasp the opportunities and confront the challenges of dark data \\u2014 through greater strategic thinking, targeted technology investment, and more energetic and comprehensive skills training \\u2014 to take full advantage of the next data revolution. Organizations need to think now about how to bring dark data into the light. All the unknown and untapped data across your company, generated by systems, devices and interactions. \\n\\nWhy Data Stays Dark? \\nDark data contains records of all the activity and behavior of customers, users, transactions, applications, servers, networks and mobile devices. It includes configurations, message queues, the output of diagnostic commands, call detail records, sensor data from industrial systems, and more. Dark data, in short, is any data that isn\\u2019t being used. That includes the many types of data generated by an organization\\u2019s systems and applications, from machine data to server log files to customer and user data to sentiment analysis derived from social media. It\\u2019s the byproduct of day-to-day business activity, both within an organization and across the ecosystem of customers, partners and suppliers. It can be data that is considered too old or outdated to provide value, data in a format that can\\u2019t be accessed with the tools available to the organization, incomplete data or duplicate data \\u2014 any data that needs to be \\u201ccleaned\\u201d before it can be used. Often, organizations ignore potentially valuable data because they don\\u2019t have the time or resources to prepare it for use. Or they may not understand its full potential. Or they may be bogged down in the status quo, meeting day-to-day requirements rather than looking ahead for opportunities. By definition, an organization\\u2019s dark data is the most difficult to access. How do organizations improve their access to dark data and the insights it holds? Traditionally, the quick and easy (if expensive) solution was to hire a consultancy and have them explore dark data in all the data sources by doing a data scan. Today\\u2019s dark data could one day be an accelerant for even greater AI performance. Thus, the advent of AI and the value of dark data go hand-in-hand. Dark data provides an enormous, untapped resource of information that AI can analyze. And AI-powered analytics tools can help make dark data ready for analysis on a scale that would be impossible with current methods. On the one hand, dark data and artificial intelligence hold almost unlimited potential to transform business and society, and working with data will be essential to virtually every job in their organizations. On the other hand, these business and IT leaders have low confidence in their own knowledge about AI and the data their company possesses. They\\u2019re even more skeptical of their colleagues\\u2019 and their organization\\u2019s readiness to take advantage of the potential both in their troves of untapped data and in the power of AI. Make \\u201cdata driven\\u201d a reality, and make sure your approach to data helps organize and surface it in ways that will let you tap all of its potential. Understand your data. Commit to bringing more of it out of the dark, out of the gray areas, to be a vital part of your decision making. Data, like money, is an asset. Like money, a business has a fundamental responsibility to keep track of it, and use it to best advantage.\\n\\n\\nCategory: Data Infrastructure, Governance, Security\\n\\nTopic:  Data Governance\\nOne common challenge with a data lake architecture is the lack of oversight on the contents of raw data stored in the data lake. Organizations need governance, semantic consistency, and access controls to avoid the pitfalls of creating a data swamp with no curation. Data catalogs play a crucial role in data governance by providing a centralized and organized repository of metadata and information about an organization;s data assets. In active metadata management, metadata is not just stored and documented, it is continuously updated, enriched, and used in real-time to support various data management and data governance activities. The rich ecosystem of metadata connectors and dynamic discovery or crawling of data assets are key enablers for active metadata management. Data governance, focuses on the broader aspects of managing and governing data assets, including data quality, privacy, and compliance, while AI governance specifically addresses the ethical, transparent, and accountable use of AI technologies. These two governance areas often intersect and complement each other to ensure that AI systems are built on high-quality, compliant, and ethically managed data. \\n\\nTopic: Data Security\\nData security primarily focuses on protecting data assets, including data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. It encompasses the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Data masking, anonymization, tokenization, classification, and data privacy are important components of data security strategies aimed at protecting sensitive and confidential information. Data security encompasses a broader range of measures and practices aimed at protecting data assets throughout their lifecycle. AI security is a subset of data security that focuses specifically on the security of AI technologies, models, and algorithms. AI security deals with specific threats and risks associated with AI systems including machine learning models, algorithms, and AI applications. These threats may include adversarial attacks, model vulnerabilities, data poisoning, and model inversion attacks that target AI models and their operations. Data poisoning is a significant concern in AI/ML, especially when models are used in safety-critical applications like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.\\n\\nTopic: Data Infrastructure\\nEdge computing moves data processing and analysis close to endpoints where data is generated, to deliver real-time responsiveness and reduce the cost associated with transferring large amounts of data. Edge computing can pre-process data, extract relevant information, and perform initial analytics locally. After this initial processing, summarized or relevant data can be sent to a data lake or edge network for further analysis, archival, and integration with historical data. Fog computing is a decentralized computing paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network, typically one or more hops away from the edge devices. It can be thought of as an intermediate layer between the edge devices and the centralized cloud. Organizations often require both real-time analytics at the edge and more extensive, historical analysis in a centralized data lake. Hybrid analytics solutions combine edge computing, fog computing with cloud or data lake-based analytics to provide a holistic view of data. It is important to conduct a thorough assessment of data lake, AI platform requirements and workloads to determine the appropriate cost effective infrastructure need for processing power. Emergence of hybrid cloud capabilities make it a valuable tool for organizations pursuing a comprehensive data lake strategy that spans multiple environments including edge, on-premise and multiple cloud service providers. Such capabilities include a cloud-centric container platform to run computationally intensive workloads by AI/ML applications utilizing CPU\\u2019s, GPU\\u2019s at scale. Most AI/ML workloads are cloud native in nature, deployed in containers and optimized to work with GPUs. They need to co-exist with other workloads on a shared infrastructure which results in a mix of virtual machines (VMs) and containers.\\n\\nOperationalizing Data Lakes\\nWhile DevOps, DataOps and MLOps share a focus on automation, collaboration, and efficiency, they have distinct areas of emphasis. DevOps is primarily concerned with software development and deployment, while DataOps is focused on data-related processes and workflows. DataOps seeks to address challenges related to data integration, data quality, and data delivery, making it more tailored to the needs of data-driven organizations. MLOps is specifically focused on managing and operationalizing machine learning models, ensuring they perform well in production environments. By supporting interoperability of machine learning (ML) models, such as using the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format or PMML, ML models can be easily shared and deployed across different ML frameworks and inference engines.\\nIntegrating DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps for a data lake requires a comprehensive strategy that promotes collaboration, automation, and efficient workflows across these disciplines. There is a need to effectively integrate DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps practices to create a cohesive and efficient data lake environment that supports data quality, data delivery, and machine learning model deployment in a streamlined and automated manner. \\n\\n==== KNOWLEDGE BASE END ====\\n==== QUESTIONNAIRE ====\\nWhich area of your data ecosystem are you most concerned about?\\nData silos - Data trapped in departmental silos can be inaccessible to other parts.\\n==== QUESTIONNAIRE END ====\\n==== ANSWERS ====\\nData silos - Data trapped in departmental silos can be inaccessible to other parts.\\n==== ANSWERS END ====\\n",
