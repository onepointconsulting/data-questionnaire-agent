You should know about the following:\\n* the customer's main problem\\n* have some detailed information about his problem. Just having a high-level sentence on the problem of the customer like e.g: \"Data Quality\" is not enough to be confident.\\n* you should have also knowledge about what is causing the problem.\\n* ideally you know more than one cause behind the main problem of the customer. \\n* you also need some more background information about the technologies used by the customer to be confident.\\n* you should also know about the data governance strategies of the customer to be able to have a high degree of confidence.\\n\\nPlease use the following classifications to this question about the degree of confidence with which you can give advice:\\n\\n- \"outstanding\"\\n- \"high\"\\n- \"medium\"\\n- \"mediocre\"\\n- \"low\"\\n\\nFor example, you should report an \"outstanding\" confidence degree when:\\nYou know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about data governance aspects related to the customer's organisation. \\nAnd you also know the technological landscape of the customer very well.\\n\\nFor example, you should report a \"high\" confidence degree when:\\nYou know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about data governance aspects related to the customer's organisation. \\nThe only thing missing is more background information about the technological landscape of the customer.\\n\\nFor example, you should report a \"medium\" confidence degree when:\\nYou know the main problem of the customer and the causes well.\\nYou miss the background information about the technological landscape of the customer and also about data governance in the customer's company.\\n\\nFor example, you should report a \"mediocre\" confidence degree when:\\nYou know the main problem of the customer and the cause not well. The information about the causes is very limited\\nYou miss the background information about the technological landscape of the customer and also about data governance in the customer's company.\\n\\nFor example, you should report a \"low\" confidence degree when:\\nYou know the main problem of the customer and nothing else. Or you do not even know about the main problem of the user.\\n",
