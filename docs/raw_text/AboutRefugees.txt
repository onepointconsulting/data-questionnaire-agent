What is a Refugee?
A refugee is a person forced to flee their country due to violence or persecution.

Who is a refugee?
A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee their country due to persecution, war, or violence. They often have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Most refugees cannot return home or are afraid to do so due to ongoing conflicts.

Who is an internally displaced person?
An internally displaced person (IDP) is someone who has been forced to flee their home but has not crossed an international border. IDPs seek safety within their own country, often finding refuge in nearby towns, schools, settlements, or internal camps. Unlike refugees, IDPs are not protected by international law and may not have access to certain types of aid.

Who is a stateless person?
A stateless person is someone who is not a citizen of any country. This lack of citizenship may result from various factors such as legal, administrative, or technical issues. Stateless individuals may face significant challenges in accessing basic rights and services.

Who is an asylum seeker?
An asylum seeker is someone who flees their own country and seeks refuge in another country. They apply for asylum to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and assistance. Asylum seekers must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country.

What is the 1951 Refugee Convention?
The 1951 Refugee Convention is the main international instrument of refugee law. It defines who qualifies as a refugee and outlines the rights and protections they should receive from signatory countries. The Convention was initially focused on protecting European refugees after World War II but was later expanded through the 1967 Protocol to address displacement worldwide.
