Topic: Procedure to reunification of my family.
How can you find your family again?
You don’t know where your parents or your brothers and sisters are? Your family doesn’t know where you are? The tracing service of the Red Cross will help you.

You have to write a request to search for your family and relatives to the Red Cross. The request is called “search request”. Your legal representative and your care worker will help you to write the request. The service is for free.

The Red Cross will try to get in contact with your family. It will take a long time. You yourself can do something as well: Ask other people, ask friends, ask people from your country.

Sometimes the Red Cross is not successful and persons are not found. Sometimes the answer is sad, for example if persons are dead or ill.

The Federal Office for Immigration and Asylum wants to know where your family is. The Federal Office for Immigration and Asylum will search for your family. The law says that you have to help the Federal Office for Immigration and Asylum in this search. Ask your legal representative. Tell the Federal Office for Immigration and Asylum if you don’t want to search for your family. Explain why.

Is your family allowed to come to Austria?
You want your parents to be with you? You have got the right to live together with your parents. This is called “family reunification”. There are many requirements. For example: You must be younger than 18 years when asking for family reunification. And you must have asylum or, for 3 years already, subsidiary protection in Austria.

You have applied for asylum, then turned 18 years and afterwards received a positive decision? Contact the Red Cross as soon as possible, they give you more information.

The process of family reunification is very complicated and can take a long time. Your family has to apply for reunification with the Austrian Consulate. For help please talk to your legal representative or care worker. They will help.

### I am under 18 and I would like to bring my family to Austria.
You are under 18. You have asylum in Austria (positive notification) or subsidiary protection (visa, paragraph 8)? Your family can come to Austria.

 

Your parents have to submit the request for family reunification at an Austrian Embassy. They have to submit the request while you are under 18. This is a complex procedure. Please contact an advisor or the Red Cross.


When can I bring my family to Austria?

Do you have asylum in Austria? Now you can bring your family to Austria.

Do you have subsidiary protection in Austria? You have to wait 3 years. Then you can bring your family to Austria.

Your request of asylum is not finalised yet? You have not received a notification yet. You cannot bring your family to Austria. A request of family reunification cannot be submitted at this time.


----

### Which members of the family can I bring to Austria?

You can bring to Austria:

Your parents.
Your siblings are under 18 and they are not married? They can come.
 

Your siblings are married? Are they over 18? They cannot come.

Your parents died? Your siblings cannot come. They can come only with your parents.

 

Who cannot come?

Your grandparents.
Uncles, aunts, cousins and other members of the Family.


----
### What does the family need to do?

Your family has to reach an Austrian Embassy. There, the family will apply for family reunification.

There is no Austrian Embassy in your country? Your family will need to reach an Austrian embassy in another country. It is not possible to submit the request at another embassy (for example: German Embassy).

Example: your parents live in Afghanistan. There is no Austrian Embassy at the moment. For the application for family reunification your family has to reach Iran or Pakistan.

The application for family reunification needs to be done at an Austrian Embassy. Your family cannot apply at another embassy (of another state).

Here you will find all Austrian embassies,

For the application for family reunification the family needs an appointment at the embassy. The family needs to ask for an appointment. The embassy will inform when the family can go. How long the family has to wait for an appointment depends on each embassy.

Your parents wait for an appointment at the embassy and you are 18 now? You need to act fast. The family can apply also per E-Mail at the embassy. Please contact an advisor or the Red Cross!

### Which documents does the family need?

1) Application for family reunification.

2) ID.

3) Documents.

 

1) The family needs the application for family reunification („application and form for family reunification“). It is available in many languages. It is free: Download

Each member of the family needs to apply. Example: your mum and your sister will come. You will need 2 application forms.

The applications usually do not need to be translated.

 

2) Each person needs these documents:

A valid passport.
Birth certificate. Your birth certificate too.
Marriage certificate of the parents.
2 passport photos.
 

3) You will need to send these documents to your family:

Copy of your notification (asylum or subsidiary protection).
Copy of the registration form (Meldezettel).
Copy of your passport or ID.
 

These documents are very expensive? Is it difficult to obtain these documents? Does it take long to obtain the documents?

They are required for each member.

Is it impossible to obtain one document? Please contact an advisor.

Where do I get help?

 

First of all, the family needs all documents, then has to reach an Austrian Embassy with all required documents.

 

Your family has reached an embassy and a document is missing? The family would like to submit the missing document later? This is OK but the procedure can take longer.


---- 
### My family reached an Austrian Embassy, now what happens?

The embassy will send all documents to the Federal Office for Asylum and Foreign Services (Bundesamt für Fremdenwesen und Asyl -BFA) in Austria. The documents will be submitted to a judge, it is often the same judge that confirmed your notification, he is familiar with your story.

 

It is possible that the embassy or the Federal Office (BFA) will interview your family. The BFA has to be sure that you really are family. You can show the BFA pictures or other documents. It is possible that the BFA will require a DNA test.

 

The BFA will decide and send a notification to the embassy, which will inform your family. Is the final decision positive? Your family will get a visa. The family has 4 months to reach Austria.

 

Is the decision negative? The embassy will inform your family.


----
### What is a DNA test?

Maybe the judge does not believe you are family. He will ask for a DNA test!

The DNA test is a proof that you are really related.

How to do a DNA test?

Please go to a laboratory. Ask for an appointment. At the laboratory, you will provide a bit of your saliva/spit. The laboratory will send the test to the Austrian Embassy. Your family will need to reach the embassy and provide a bit saliva/spit too. The embassy will then send back the test to the lab in Austria. The laboratory will finally have an answer.

A DNA test can cost around €200 per person. Example: you want to bring your wife and your 3 children. The DNA test will cost around €1000. You will have to pay for the DNA test yourself.

The answer is positive and your family is in Austria? You will receive the money back.

The BFA requires a DNA test from your side? Please contact an advisor or the Red Cross.

### Family reunification:How long can it take?How much can it cost?

Your family reached an Austrian Embassy. Between the day at the embassy and the day your family leaves the country it can take between 8 and 12 months.

The visa is free. You will have to pay the expense for travelling to the embassy and your travel/tickets to Austria. You will also have to pay for documents and translations.




----
### Negative decision: what to do now?

The Austrian Embassy sent a negative notification to your family? The family can file a complaint. There is only 4 weeks time to do that. The complaint has to be filed quickly.

You received a negative notification? Please contact an advisor or the Red Cross.

Where do I get help?

Your family filed a complaint. All documents will be send to the Austrian Federal Court. Here another judge will examine the file


----

### My family is in Austria! And now?

Your family arrived in Austria. You need accommodation from the first day of arrival. The accommodation is too small for the whole family? Please contact an advisor or the Red Cross.

Where do I get help?

 

Your family arrives in Austria. The following day the family needs to fill the registration form (Meldezettel). The family will submit the registration form (Meldezettel) to the BFA and request asylum.

 

Your family needs to receive the same decision as yours. Maybe your family will receive a better one.

Example: you have subsidiary protection, your parents receive asylum.
