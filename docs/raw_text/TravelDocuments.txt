Since 2015, travel documents for beneficiaries of international protection are issued for a period of up to 5 years,[1] unless other conditions apply. Refugees obtain a Convention travel document (‘Konventionsreisepass’) without further conditions, unless there are compelling reasons in terms of national security and public order against the issuance of a document,[2] whereas beneficiaries of subsidiary protection must establish that they are unable to obtain a travel document from their country of origin.[3] Aliens whose presence on federal territory is tolerated are to be issued a permit for tolerated persons. As a general rule, it is valid for one year and can be extended for another year provided certain conditions are met. A geographical limitation further applies to beneficiaries of protection, who are not allowed to travel to their country of origin with these documents.

Article 94(2) FPG allows persons recognised as refugees in another country to apply for a Convention travel document in Austria.

Aliens who applied for international protection on or after November 15, 2015 and were awarded asylum status on or after June 1, 2016 are eligible to apply for the card for those entitled to asylum. In 2021, 44,516 Convention travel documents were issued to refugees and 5,016 Fremdenpässe (travel documents for foreigners) were issued. However, there is no data how many of those were issued to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection.[4]
