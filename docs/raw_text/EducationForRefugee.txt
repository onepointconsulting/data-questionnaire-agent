Validation of an academic degree (Nostrifizierung)
Validation is the conversion of a foreign university degree into a corresponding (bachelor's, master's, diploma or doctor's) Austrian one by the organ in charge of study affairs at a university or university of applied sciences.

Academic degrees are validated for work purposes only. For example: If you have a medical degree and would like to work in Austria as a medical doctor, the degree will have to be validated. This means that you have to submit an application to an Austrian university, university of applied sciences or public university college of teacher education that offers a comparable study programme; they will verify whether your degree is comparable with the respective Austrian degree. You might be asked to undergo additional training as a non-degree student.

If the validation is denied, you might still be able to enrol in a comparable study programme and receive credit for parts of your previous studies. Please be aware that you will need a "Nostrifizierung" for certain professional fields; a list can be found here.

For more information about the validation of a degree please visit these websites:

Start or continuation of a study program at a higher education institution
In order to be admitted to a study programme you will have to fulfil certain requirements. For example, Austrian higher education institutions usually teach in German (some programmes are available in English. You will find more information about study programmes at www.studienwahl.at). Please contact the respective university for information about deadlines, conditions and accepted language certificates. Please be aware that you need to obtain detailed information about admission requirements directly from the respective university. If you meet all requirements and have all diplomas and certificates at the time of application, you can enrol as a student. Possible conditions are:

Hochschulreife: The institution will compare your qualifications to Austrian standards before admitting you to a study programme. You have to present proof that you have completed your secondary level education; if necessary, you will have to complete additional classes (among others, language skills: Admission to a study programme usually requires a language level of at least B2, for some programmes up to C2).
Some study programmes require entrance exams.
Admission to a master's degree requires a bachelor's degree or diploma degree from the same academic field.
Admission to a doctorate or PhD requires a master’s or diploma degree from the same academic field.
If you are planning to continue a study programme that you started abroad and had to abandon, you might be able to get credit for successful exams. The institution will check your qualifications.
People who have been granted asylum or subsidiary protection do not need an admission statement from a university in their home country (German term: besondere Universitätsreife).
If you do not have the necessary certificates by the time you apply for admission to a study programme, the institution might enrol you as a non-degree student. This means that you will be able to attend a University Preparation Programme and continue studying as a regular student after completing it. Austrian Universities
