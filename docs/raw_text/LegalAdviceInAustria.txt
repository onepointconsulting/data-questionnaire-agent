1. Legal Advice

General

Free legal advice is available in connection with the asylum procedure. Legal advisers are provided ex officio to assist applicants, especially in filing appeals.

Since January 1, 2021, legal advice has been under the responsibility of the Federal Agency for Reception and Support Services.

In the Admission Procedure

A claim to legal advice arises where there is an intention to hold a hearing within 72 hours of the delivery of a notification of plans to reject or dismiss an application for international protection. In these cases, the asylum-seeker will be referred to the legal advice service by the BFA before a hearing is held.

In the Admitted Procedure

There is no entitlement to legal advice in the admitted asylum procedure. However, free legal advice can be provided to foreigners subject to ongoing proceedings within the remit of the BFA, where circumstances allow.

Appeal Proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court

In all appeal proceedings against decisions by the BFA, legal advice is provided ex officio, except for rulings regarding costs or the submission of files in connection with an appeal on the grounds of omission.
