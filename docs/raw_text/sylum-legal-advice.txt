Category:Asylum Legal Advice

Our team of asylum and migration law lawyers advise and support refugees and other migrants in their cases and related issues. The advice is free of charge.

We offer personal advice and support you regarding any legal questions in asylum or migration matters. As part of this advice we assess your prospects of receiving leave to remain in Austria. Furthermore, we are able to advise you regarding the necessary administrative procedures, the legal situation in your individual case, and can explain the effect and meaning of any decisions made by the immigration authorities. We can also draft and lodge documents with the authorities to ensure that your rights in your case are protected.
