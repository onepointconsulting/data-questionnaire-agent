REGULAR PROCEDURE IN Austria(A):

General (scope, time limits)

The regular asylum procedure is regulated in the AsylG (predominantly material law) and AVG and BFA-VG (predominantly procedural law).

As already mentioned, the BFA is a specific department of the Ministry of interior, dealing with asylum matters. In 2014, the tasks of the BAF were further extended to cover some immigration law procedures.

According to the General Administrative Procedures Act (AVG), decisions have to be taken within 6 months after the application for international protection has been lodged.[1] Within 20 calendar days, the BFA has to decide whether it intends to reject the application as inadmissible due to the responsibility of another Member State under the Dublin Regulation, the application of the safe third country concept or in case of subsequent asylum applications, or to dismiss the application for other reasons.[2] Since 2018, the admissibility procedure may be prolonged by lifting the 20 days deadline in manifestly unfounded cases.[3] However, if no information about the intention to reject the application is issued within 20 calendar days, the application is automatically admitted into the regular procedure. Thus, the asylum-seeker should receive the preliminary residence permit as asylum seeker and be allocated to the reception system of a federal province.[4] On the contrary, if the asylum application is deemed inadmissible the asylum-seeker receives legal assistance and has to be heard in presence of they lawyer. There is no legal remedy against this procedural order.

If no procedural order is notified to the asylum seeker within 20 days, the asylum application is admitted to the regular procedure – except in Dublin cases if requests to other Member States to take charge or take back the asylum seeker are made within this time frame.

In case of delay from the BFA, the asylum seeker may request that the case be referred to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision (Säumnisbeschwerde).[5] However, in practice asylum seekers do not frequently make such requests, as they miss a chance of receiving a positive decision at first instance (by the BFA). In 2023, several asylum seekers and counselling organisations reported that one lawyer based in Vienna filed Säumnisbeschwerde in around 1,000 asylum cases. In case of delay from the Federal Administrative Court, a request for the establishment of a deadline may be addressed to the Administrative High Court.

In 2023 the average duration of the asylum procedure at first instance amounted to 5.5 months,[6] compared to 3.5 months in 2022 and 3.2 months in 2021.[7] The sharp drop after 2017 (average duration of 14 months) is a result of the broader application of fast track procedures. In 2020, 807 applications were fast tracked,[8] out of which 405 were rejected within 72 hours by the BFA. In 27 cases the decision was appealed but the rejection was then upheld by the BVwG.[9] The average length of the fast-track procedure was 22.7 days in 2020.

In 2023, the number of decisions taken in the fast-track procedure decreased compared to the record number of 2022. 8,121 decisions were taken in the fast-track procedures (compared to 22,109 in 2022 and 2,581 in 2021). The average length of the fast-track procedure in the first half of 2023 was 34.5 days (2022: 24.7 days).[10] The accelerated procedure led to 300 decisions in 2023, and in 88.5% of the cases the decision was issued within 72 hours (2022: 67%).

The decisions in both fast-track and accelerated procedures mainly concerned applicants from countries listed as safe countries of origin and manifestly ill-founded applications from applicants from India. In the accelerated procedure, 59% of the decisions concerned applicants from Morocco, 16% from India and 9% from Pakistan. In fast track procedures, 84% concerned Moroccan applicants, 4% applicants from Pakistan and 3% from Tunisia.[11]

In recent years, the Austrian Ombudsman has received numerous complaints on the length of asylum procedures at first instance. It received 1,500 complaints in 2016; 2,000 complaints in 2017 and 320 complaints in 2018. Out of the 320 complaints received in 2018, a violation of the duty to take a decision within the set limit was confirmed in 248 cases. Moreover, in 2018, 220 complaints were filed concerning length of procedures at second instance, and in 176 cases a violation was identified.[12] In 2020, the Austrian Ombudsman concluded in 197 cases that the BVwG violated its obligation to make a decision and did not take any steps in the asylum complaint procedure, reiterating that organisational deficiencies and increasing asylum applications are not a legally relevant justification. The Ombudsman suggested that the procedure should be concluded quickly in the cases brought forward. Numerous complaints were filed concerning deficiencies in the first instance proceedings.[13] In 2021, the Austrian Ombudsman Board received 14 complaints concerning the length of first-instance asylum procedures and 151 complaints mainly about the length of second-instance asylum procedures from 1 January to 17 September 2021.[14] After a decrease in the number of complaints over several years, there was a significant increase in the summer of 2022. 418 persons lodged a complaint concerning the length of the procedure, of which 284 were decided by the Ombudsperson. In 195 cases, the complaints were justified; in 95 cases the BFA decided after the complaint was lodged.[15] In 2023, 771 persons lodged a complaint concerning the BFA, and 489 complaints were deemed justified. 527 complaints concerned applicants from 2022, mostly from Syria (455). 69 cases concerned the family reunification process, of which 25 complaints concerning the length of procedures were justified. In one case the embassy had sent the file to the BFA in October 2022 and the BFA had not undertaken any procedural step in a whole year.[16]

At the end of 2023, 38,921 (2022: 53,107) cases were pending, out of which 30,258 (2022: 46,811) at first instance and 8,663 (2022: 6,296) at second instance.[17] The second instance backlog slightly increased after decreasing for several years. The number of pending cases at first instance decreased by 34% (from 46,000 to 30,000) compared to 2022.[18] Given that the number of recipients of Basic Care increased only by 4,500 over the year (January 17,000 in January to 21,500 in December) and the high number of discontinued cases (42,000), it is to be expected that the number of applicants actually still residing in Austria is much lower than the number of pending cases. The BFA files a case as discontinued three months after not being able to reach the applicant.

Prioritised examination and fast-track processing
The time limit for decisions for the BFA and the Federal Administrative Court are reduced to 3 months in case the asylum seeker is detained pending deportation.[19] The same maximum time limit applies to the “procedure for the initiation of a measure terminating residence” (see Accelerated Procedure).

In 2023, the practice of fast-track processing focused on applicants coming from countries listed as “safe countries of origin” and on manifestly ill-founded applications. In second instance, there is also a focus on applicants who have already been sentenced by a criminal court. The great majority of fast-track processing deals with cases from applicants originating from so called safe countries of origin (see Safe Country of Origin). This was also due to the high number of applications from Morocco at the start of 2023.

 

Personal interview
All asylum seekers must undergo a personal interview, provided that they have legal capacity to do so. At the start of each interview, asylum seekers are asked whether they feel physically and psychologically fit for the interview. If not, the interview will be postponed. In practice, a postponement is not requested by the applicants.

Asylum seekers are further subject to an interrogation by security services shortly after lodging the application for the purposes of the Dublin and Admissibility Procedure.[22] These interrogations are carried out with a view to establish the identity and the travel route of the asylum seeker. They should not, however, refer to the merits of the application such as specific reasons for fleeing and lodging an asylum application. Despite the fact that the first interrogation is conducted by the police and not by caseworkers of the BFA,[23] the statements made by the asylum seeker at this stage of the admissibility procedure have an important impact on the asylum procedure as they are accorded particular importance by the BFA.[24] The Constitutional Court confirmed in a judgement of 2012 that reasons for applying for international protection shall not be in the focus of the first interview conducted by police services.[25]

Asylum seekers may be accompanied by a person they trust (i.e. person of confidence) and unaccompanied children cannot be interviewed without the presence of their legal representative.[26]

The law further provides for a choice of interviewer according to gender considerations in cases where the asylum seeker’s fear of persecution is related to sexual self-determination.[27] The authorities must demonstrate that they have informed the asylum applicant of the possibility to be interviewed by an official of the same sex.[28] In practice, however, this is not consistently applied with regard to interpreters.[29] In the appeal procedure, infringements of the right to sexual self-determination have to be expressed in the written appeal in order to have the hearing at the Court held by a judge of the same sex. The Constitutional Court ruled that UNHCR guidelines have to be applied to male asylum seekers accordingly.[30]

Interpretation
Interpreters are provided by the BFA and cover most of the languages, but interviews may also be conducted in a language the asylum seeker is deemed to understand sufficiently.[31] The provision of interpreters has been reported as not satisfactory with regard to certain languages, even in cases where a significant number of asylum seekers may be concerned (e.g. Chechen refugees are often interviewed in Russian).[32] Asylum seekers are asked at the beginning of the interview if they understand the interpreter. There are no standards for the qualification of interpreters in asylum procedures. Interpretation is often not done by accredited interpreters; usually persons with the requested language knowledge are contracted on a case-by-case basis. UNHCR has published a training manual for interpreters in asylum procedures.[33]

The Federal Law on the Establishment of the Federal Agency for Care and Support Services Limited Liability Company (BBU-G) passed in June 2019 foresees that a federal agency annexed to the Ministry of Interior should be responsible for the provision of interpreters for the purpose of asylum procedures as of 1 January 2021. This includes the provision of interpreters both at first and second instance, but also in case of oral hearings in front of the BVwG as well as in procedures concerning basic support. The law lists a wide range of areas in which interpreters should be provided by the federal agency, inter alia for interviews related to the making of an application for international protection; for measures relating to the termination of the right to stay as well as for the granting or limitation of basic services. As of January 2021, nine interpreters (five full time equivalent) were employed by the BBU GmbH.[34] In practice, the service provided by internal interpreters were not of great relevance but is to be seen as a test phase for a possible expansion of the department in future. The state-run agency took over the existing system established by the NGOs. In most cases, external interpreters were hired throughout 2023.

Videoconferencing, recording and transcript
Article 19(3) AsylG allows for tape recording of the interview, which is, however, rarely used in practice.

Video conferencing was introduced in 2018. The BFA in Burgenland held interviews to assist the BFA in Vienna and in Vorarlberg in this context.[35] This new practice is based on Art. 51a of the General Administrative Act, which allows the use of technical facilities for word and image transmission – unless a personal interview is necessary for economical or personal reasons.

There are concerns about the practice of conducting interviews through video conferencing as there is no standard procedure to handle these new tools and they raise issues of confidentiality and procedural rights. Lawyers reported an increase in videoconferencing by the BFA and BVwGH during 2020. In most cases, it is up to the applicant and the legal representative to arrange the necessary technical equipment. Issues reported in certain cases include: a judge turning off the video during a court session; the impossibility to see the translator on video; the fact that in certain cases the judges did not allow the legal representative to sit in the room as the applicant; or the fact that in certain cases a protocol was sent without encryption. The Ministry of Interior reported if there are statistics as to in how many interviews videoconferencing tools were applied in 2022 and 2023.[36]

It should be noted that, as part of its BRIDGE project, UNHCR Austria has produced a checklist “Self-check for interviews and negotiations using technical equipment for word and image transmission in the asylum procedure” for videoconferences in asylum procedures.[37]

The transcript is more or less verbatim. Its content may depend on the caseworkers’ and interpreter’s summarising the answers, choosing expressions that fit the transcript or translating each sentence of the asylum seeker.[38] Immediately after the interview, the transcript is translated by the same interpreter in a language the asylum seeker understands and the asylum seeker has the possibility to ask for corrections and completion immediately after the interview. By signing the transcript, they agree with its content. If asylum seekers find something incorrect in the transcript after having signed it at the end of the interview, they should send a written statement to the BFA as soon as possible.[39] In practice, asylum seekers do not frequently ask immediately after the interview for correction of the report. Some asylum seekers explain that they were too tired to be able to follow the translation of the transcript.[40] The OHCHR stated in its report on the mission to Austria from October 2018 that many caseworkers of the BFA are not adequately trained in using techniques that fit the needs of asylum applicants. In a number of cases monitored by the OHCHR, negative decisions of the BFA were based on personal views and involved biased questioning during interviews as well as stereotypes on gender and race.[41]

Appeal
Appeal before the BVwG
Appeals against a negative first instance decision generally have to be submitted within 4 weeks of the receipt of the decision and the whole asylum file is forwarded by the BFA to the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG).[42] However, following an amendment that came into effect on 1 September 2018, the time limit has been set at 2 weeks for appeals in inadmissibility procedures and in cases of status withdrawals that were initiated along with a return decision.[43]

Within 2 months following the lodging of an appeal, the BFA may decide to modify the decision that is being challenged.[44] This means that it can decide either to annul, reject or change its initial decision. However, where the BFA refrains from modifying its decision, it forwards the appeal to the Court. In practice, there are not many cases known where the BFA decides to modify its own decision.

In case refugee status or subsidiary protection status is not granted by the BFA, the asylum applicant will be assigned a free legal adviser provided by the state at the time of notification of the first instance decision. Since January 2021, legal assistance is provided by a new federal agency, however (see Legal Assistance).

Article 18(1) BFA-VG provides that the suspensive effect of the appeal may be withdrawn by the BFA where the application is manifestly unfounded, i.e. where:

The applicant comes from a safe country of origin;
Has already been resident in Austria for at least 3 months prior to the lodging of the application;
The applicant has attempted to deceive the BFA concerning their true identity or nationality or the authenticity of their documents;
The asylum seeker has not adduced any reasons for persecution;
The allegations made by the asylum seeker concerning the danger they face clearly do not correspond with reality;
An enforceable deportation order or an enforceable entry ban was issued against the asylum seeker prior to the lodging of the application for international protection; or
The asylum seeker refuses to give fingerprints.
The BFA uses this possibility to withdraw the suspensive effect especially when there is an enforceable deportation order or when there are no reasons for persecution stated, NGO counselling organisations told asylkoordination.

Moreover, the BFA must withdraw the suspensive effect of an appeal where:[45]

The immediate departure of the third-country national is required for reasons of public policy or public security;
The third-country national has violated an entry ban and has returned to Austrian territory; or
There is a risk of absconding.
The BVwG must grant automatic suspensive effect within 1 week from the lodging of the appeal, where it assumes that return would expose the concerned person to a real risk of a violation of Articles 2, 3, 8 and 13 ECHR or Protocols 6; or to a serious threat to life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of conflict in line with Article 15(c) of the recast Qualification Directive.[46] The reasons must be set out in the main complaint. In cases where there is an enforceable deportation order and no reason for persecution stated, the BVwG does not grant suspensive effect.[47]

Appeals against the rejection of an application with suspensive effect have to be ruled by the Court within 8 weeks.[48] The asylum appeal has suspensive effect as long as the case is pending in court.

The BVwG is organised in chambers, each of which is responsible for certain groups of countries. In recent years, the Court processed appeals on asylum cases as follows:

Following the increase of appeals and backlog of cases at second instance, judges from different fields of law have gradually been assigned to decide upon asylum procedures since 2017; despite their lack of expertise on asylum-related matters. In 2022, the BVwG concluded 13,300 procedures in which 20,500 decisions were taken. 9,700 decisions of the BFA were cancelled/annulled or amended by the BVwG, while 7,900 decisions of the BFA were confirmed.[49] 6,500 court hearings were conducted in 2022 and 4,550 in the first half of 2023. In the first half of 2023, in 4,320 first instance cases the appeal was sustained and the decisions were cancelled/annulled or amended. In 5,070 cases the decisions of the first instance were confirmed.[50]

Note: JH refers to the first half of the year (January to June)

By 2023, more than 40% of all decisions challenged were dismissed or amended by the BVwG. This confirms the trend of the last years, with consistently at least one third of decisions being overturned. Moreover, the first instance authority now evaluates whether the reason why a decision was annulled or amended were external or internal. External factors are e.g. a change of situation in the country of origin since the first instance decision took place or if new evidence was brought in. Internal factors are e.g. inaccurate investigations, (legal) interpretation mistakes or formal errors committed by the authority. In 2022, 11,049 challenged decisions (2021: 15,353) were decided upon by the BVwG. 4,662 (2021: 5,852) first instance decisions were confirmed, while 5,364 (2021: 8,146) decisions were annulled or amended. The rest were neutral decisions.

According to the analysis tool BERT, 2,803 decisions were annulled or amended because of internal reasons. This means more than 52% were annulled or amended for internal reasons such as mistakes of the authority.[51]

The BVwG can request another hearing and additional examinations if necessary. Conversely, the BFA-VG also allows for exceptions to a personal hearing on an appeal; i.e. a hearing must not be held if the facts seem to be established from the case file or if it is established that the submission of the applicant does not correspond to the facts.[52] This provision must be read in light of the restrictions on the submission of new facts in the appeal procedure.

It should be further noted that video conferencing tools are available at a small scale at the Courts, but they are rarely used.

The question whether a personal hearing before the BVwG has to take place or not has been brought before the Constitutional Court (VfGH). The Court ruled that not holding a personal hearing in the appeal procedure does not violate Article 47(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Charter rights may be pleaded before the Constitutional Court. The Court stated that Article 41(7) AsylG,[53] is in line with Article 47(2) of the EU Charter if the applicant was heard in the administrative procedure.[54] However, subsequent rulings of the Administrative High Court and the Constitutional Court have conversely specified the obligation of the Administrative Court to conduct a personal hearing. In the case of an Afghan asylum seeker, the Administrative Court had confirmed the first instance decision which found the asylum seeker’s application to be lacking credibility due to discrepancies in statements about his age. The Constitutional Court ruled that, by deciding without a personal hearing, the Administrative Court had violated the right laid down in Article 47(2) of the EU Charter.[55] Two rulings to the same effect were delivered by the Constitutional Court in September 2014.[56]

The Administrative High Court has specified that all relevant facts have to be assessed by the determining authority and have to be up to date at the time of the decision of the court.[57] It further stated that it was not necessary to explicitly request an oral hearing if the facts were not sufficiently clear or if the statements of the applicant in their appeal contradicted the statements taken by the first instance authority.[58]

The possible outcome of an appeal can be the granting of a status, the refusal of a status, or a referral by the BVwG back to the BFA for further investigations and a re-examination of the case. Hearings at the Court are public, but the public may be excluded on certain grounds. Decisions of the BVwG are published on the legal information website of the Federal Chancellery.[59]

As regards the average processing time for the appeal body to make a decision, the Ministry of Justice indicated that 22.4% of appeals challenging decisions of the BFA in asylum procedures were concluded within 6 months in 2020, while 17.4% took longer than 3 years.[60] 409 Dublin cases were decided in 2020, of which 353 were decided within 6 months (86%).[61] Disaggregated data on the average processing time at second instance were shared in 2020 as follows. Data from July 2022 show the processing time of pending cases during the first half of the year:

Onward appeal before the VwGH

Decisions of the BVwG may be appealed before the VwGH. The eligibility to appeal to the VwGH is determined by the BVwG, but in case the Administrative Court declares a regular revision as inadmissible, the asylum seeker may lodge an “extraordinary” revision.[62] For that purpose, the applicant may submit a request for free legal assistance as well as for the suspensive effect of the complaint.

Out of 1,027 (2021: 2,130 2020: 1,633) revisions conducted in 2022, 29 (2021: 18, 2020: 35) were regular revisions and 998 (2021: 2,112,2020: 1,598) were extraordinary revisions. In 2022, out of the 29 regular revisions, 9 were requested by the determining authority and 20 by applicants. Out of the 998 extraordinary revisions, 66 were requested the determining authority and 932 by applicants.[63]. In 2021, 268 revisions were granted and the decision of the BVwG was cancelled. Corresponding data for 2023 is not available.

In case the asylum applicant seeks to challenge the decision in front of the BVwG and if they claim it is violating a constitutional right, they can lodge an appeal within 6 weeks, after the ruling of the Federal Administrative Court has become final. Asylum seekers are informed of the possibility to address a complaint to the Constitutional Court in writing and this information is translated in a language the asylum seeker understands. In that context, it has to be mentioned that the ECHR is part of Austria’s constitutional law. Therefore the risk of violation of Articles 2, 3 or 8 ECHR can be challenged in front of the Constitutional Court, while the rejection of an application for international protection does not fall under the Court’s competence. The appeal does not have automatic suspensive effect, however. Around 97 decisions of the BVwG, in which the decision was considered arbitrary, have been ruled unlawful by the Constitutional Court in 2019.[64] In 2020, 107 decisions were considered arbitrary and ruled unlawful by the Constitutional Court.[65] No data was available for 2021-2023 at the time of writing.

Asylum seekers face difficulties to access constitutional appeals as the payment of a fee of € 240 is required to that end. Furthermore, asylum seekers are not heard in person before the Constitutional Court, which rather requests written statements from the BVwG.

 

Legal assistance
Legal assistance at first instance
In June 2019, the Austrian Parliament adopted a law establishing a Federal Agency for Care and Support Services (Bundesagentur für Betreuungs- und Unterstützungsleistungen, BBU GmbH) which is in charge inter alia of providing legal assistance to asylum seekers at first and second instance since 1 January 2021. The new law has been criticised by several organisations, as it raises concerns over the risk of arbitrary access to free legal assistance. In its Legal note on the Austrian law, ECRE demonstrated that while access to legal assistance at first instance was the general rule under the previous Article 49(1) BFA-VG, it becomes the exception under the new law. With the exception of unaccompanied minors, legal assistance at first instance shall now only be provided according to the “available possibilities”, and does not constitute a right, except in specific cases listed in the Asylum Act. In other words, access to free legal assistance at first instance is only granted when existing resources are available (e.g. staff and funding), and is not a right for all.[66]

Moreover, the reform introduces a new threshold which grants the asylum applicant the right to free legal assistance by the Agency only if an appointment – during which the applicant exercises their right to be heard – is scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) after having been notified by the BFA of the intention to reject the asylum application. This means that, if the BFA grants the asylum applicant the right to be heard at a later stage (e.g. in 4 or 5 days), free legal assistance by the Agency will only be available if resources so allow. Consequently, there is a risk of arbitrary access to free legal assistance at first instance which will largely depend on the BFA’s goodwill allowing the asylum applicant to be heard in due time.

The BBU GmbH has some AMIF funded capacities in first instance and provides open counselling in first instance as long as “possibilities are available”. The counselling services are provided at the buildings of the regional directorates of the BFA. There is no funding for transportation costs for persons willing to receive counselling at this stage. At first instance, the BBU GmbH has the legal obligation to provide legal counselling in all procedures where the first interview by the BFA is conducted within 72 hours. In these procedures, the counsellors of the BBU also have to take part in the interviews carried out with the BFA. At the time of writing, this concerned mainly subsequent applications, fast-track procedures and procedures at the airport. The BBU GmbH is not being appointed in Dublin cases by the BFA and therefore is not involved in interviews in these procedures in general in first instance.

It should be noted, however, that the previous legal aid-system in place until the end of 2020 did not meet the needs of asylum seekers either. VMÖ, which received most of the funding for legal assistance in the first instance procedure,[67] was criticised for not being very helpful nor committed to the protection of the rights of asylum seekers due to its cooperation with the Ministry of Interior.[68]

While the BBU GmbH is a federal agency owned by the Ministry of Interior, the head of legal counselling (and the counsellors themselves) are not bound by directives of the CEO of the BBU GmbH. The head of legal counselling is appointed by the Ministry of Justice and has the technical supervision, while administrative/disciplinary supervision lies under the responsibility of the CEO of BBU GmbH. This fairly complex construction should prevent pressure and interference from the Ministry of Interior (which is also the head of the BFA) on the legal counselling unit.

Even though some improvements were achieved in comparison to the previous dysfunctional legal aid system (e.g. trainings of legal advisors, legal aid in front of the High Courts, setting up quality standards), the centralised legal aid system under the BBU GmbH is very fragile from a fundamental rights perspective. The Ministry of Interior still has the right to nominate half of the members of the supervisory board, even if it only appointed two external experts in 2020. An expert board was founded to establish counselling standards.

In December 2023, the Constitutional Court issued a decision declaring the central legislative act of the BBU-G not in accordance with the Austrian constitution. The independence of legal advice for asylum seekers and aliens by the Federal Care Agency is only laid out in the form of a contract between the Agency and the Ministry, but not adequately guaranteed by law, which is why the right to an effective legal remedy is violated. The corresponding provisions in the BBU Establishment Act (BBU-G) and the BFA Procedural Act (BFA-VG) are repealed as unconstitutional. The Constitutional Court has ruled that the legislative bodies have until July 1, 2025 to introduce new legal regulations, otherwise the central legislative act of the BBU-G will be out of force by this date and hence the BBU GmbH will no longer be allowed to conduct legal assistance.

Indeed, due to several complaints from asylum seekers against the findings of the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG), the Constitutional Court had concerns as to whether the provisions regarding the provision of legal advice and representation by the Federal Agency for Care and Support Services (BBU GmbH) complied with the constitutional requirements of Article 47 of the EU -Fundamental Rights Charter (right to an effective remedy) and Article 20 B-VG (administration of bodies that are fundamentally bound by instructions).

In the view of the Constitutional Court, the prerequisite for effective legal protection is that the BBU’s legal advisors are not subject to instructions and are independent, particularly from the Minister of the Interior, who is responsible for enforcing immigration law. The independence of legal advisors is enshrined in law. However, the position of the legal advisors in the BBU and in relation to the Minister of the Interior, who acts as the owner’s representative in the BBU under company law, is spelled out in more detail in a contract. But, by concluding this framework agreement, the management of the BBU is bound to instructions from the Minister of the Interior (together with the Minister of Justice) in terms of corporate law. The contractual regulation is therefore not sufficient to effectively implement the independence of legal advice.

Conversely, the private law structure of BBU GmbH as such is found to be constitutional. The legal advice and representation designed in this way does not represent functional state administrative management within the meaning of Article 20 Paragraph 1 B-VG. The legislature does have a legal entity controlled by the state to provide legal advice and representation. However, this activity is a service for the affected asylum seekers and aliens to enforce their rights in asylum and alien law procedures, which can also be provided (and is also provided) by private individuals. The provisions regarding legal advice and representation by the BBU therefore do not violate Article 20 Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 B-VG.[69]

Legal assistance in appeals
Legal aid provided by the new BBU GmbH since 2021

The BBU GmbH counselling unit is now composed of former employees of Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst and VMÖ. The BBU GmbH was obliged to offer jobs to all employees of the latter organisations. As of September 2023, a total of 140.2 full time equivalents of counselling staff was employed by the BBU GmbH.[70] While in the past legal advisers did not have to meet specific qualifications or training standards, all future advisors must hold a degree in law from an Austrian University and have completed a compulsory internship at a court. These requirements do not apply, however, to all previous staff already employed at VMÖ and ARGE organisations.[71]

As opposed to the previous legal aid system where the contract between the service providers and the government did not foresee quality standards for the provision legal aid, the new contract between the BBU GmbH and the government has improved this aspect.[72] A particular concern was the fact that the quality of legal aid provided by VMÖ largely depended on the individual counsellor. The head of the counselling unit established a formation and training process consisting of three stages. In the third stage new counsellors work under supervision and receive permission to counsel on their own after positive evaluation. The formation and training course partly involves external experts and judges from Court and was also evaluated by the Qualitätsbeirat, an advisory council of the BBU GmbH.[73]

The tasks of the BBU GmbH include counselling, representation and explanation of judgements. The law requires counselling to be ‘objective’. The advisors will have to explain the perspective the applicants have. If the applicants request representation, the advisors have to act in favour of partisan interests. The main tasks will consist in writing appeals as legal representatives and representation in court sessions. The mandate prescribed by law ends upon receipt of the final decision of the Court, although the BBU GmbH must then still explain the content of the judgement and explain the perspectives. As the provision of legal aid must also meet the conditions of Article 47 of the EU Charter, it must ensure an effective access to the High Courts. Upon request by the applicants in cases where the judgement has chances to be overruled by the High Courts, the BBU GmbH must support the applicants in obtaining free legal aid from the normal legal aid system.

One project run by Caritas Austria offers assistance during the hearing before the Federal Administrative Court, but this resource is limited and therefore only a certain number of cases can be assisted. AMIF funding is no longer guaranteed but the project continues on a smaller scale with alternative funding. It also worked on a very small scale during 2022.[74]

Besides this free legal advice funded by the state, NGOs help asylum seekers lodging appeals and submitting written statements, accompany them to personal hearings at the Federal Administrative Court and may act as legal representatives. NGOs cannot represent asylum seekers before the Constitutional Court or the Administrative High Court, as this can only be done by an attorney-at-law.

Legal assistance free of charge is provided in case of the rejection of a subsequent asylum application on res judicata grounds too. The Constitutional Court and the Administrative High Court apply a merits test and tend to refuse free legal aid, if the case has little chance of succeeding. The BBU-G introduces a worrying change in this regard. The law only includes an obligation to inform applicants of the prospects of success of their appeal without stipulating any consequences. However, the approach suggested by the impact assessment of the law, if applied in practice by the Federal Agency, is extremely problematic. Whereas the recast APD does not specify which other authorities could be considered competent to apply a merits test, entrusting the Federal Agency with that task will create an obvious conflict of interest. Moreover, where another authority than a court or tribunal carries out a merits test, the applicant must have the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal against that decision, according to Article 20(3) recast Asylum Procedures Directive. If in practice the Federal Agency were to refuse free legal assistance and representation on that basis without the applicant having an effective opportunity to challenge that decision before a court or tribunal, there would be a clear breach of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive.

The centralisation of legal aid and founding of the BBU GmbH significantly restricts the potential role for and funding of civil society organisations. Since the beginning of 2021, only 10% of the staff of Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst were still employed as a result of the contract cancellation in 2020. Funding remains a difficult topic for non-governmental counselling organisations. As of December 2023, there are still several NGOs such as Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst, Caritas (active in Lower Austria, Vienna, Vorarlberg), Integrationshaus Wien, Deserteurs- und Flüchtlingsberatung, Queer Base, ZEBRA (Graz), Fluchtpunkt Tirol and tralalobe (Vienna) offering legal counselling to asylum seekers.[75]

Considering the fact that the BBU GmbH represents most applicants in the second instance procedure and the continued high rate of overturned decisions, a backsliding compared to the work of its predecessors which used to be responsible for state-provided legal assistance cannot be observed.

In 2023, BBU GmbH provided 21,633 counselling sessions (2022: 17,052) and supported applicants in 8,660 cases (2021: 5.273) to bring an appeal against negative decisions. They represented applicants in 4,917 court hearings (2022: 3,044).[76]

In practice, there is a constant exchange on general topics between the BBU GmbH and NGOs working in the field. There is broad acknowledgement of the well-established practice of counselling performed by the BBU GmbH, but the criticism on the general structure and possible influence by the Ministry of Interior remains. Even the so-called ‘Qualitätsbeirat’, a group responsible for evaluating, observing and providing recommendations to the legal counselling department, stated in its report for 2021 that the current positive development is strongly related to the personalities of the director of the institution and the head of legal counselling, who values and fosters independence in the provision of legal counselling. Nevertheless, the Qualitätsbeirat recommends to take further legislative measures to strengthen the independence of the legal counselling department.[77] In 2022, the Qualitätsbeirat focused on the assessment and improvement of the quality of the counselling provided by the BBU GmbH and on the translation services. It underlined the good quality of the services provided and the good cooperation of the BBU GmbH with the Qualitätsbeirat. Nevertheless it stressed again that legislative changes are necessary to strengthen the independence of the legal counselling department of the BBU GmbH from the Ministry of Interior.[78]  The Constitutional Court`s decision[79] (see Legal assistance at first instance) underlined all this criticism of the structural deficits of the BBU GmbH and found the legislative acts to be unconstitutional. At the time of writing, the government is negotiating a possible amendment of legal counselling within the structure of the BBU GmbH.

# Border procedure
BORDER PROCEDURE (BORDER AND TRANSIT ZONES):
General (scope, time limits)

The law provides for “procedures for the imposition of measures to terminate residence” subject to reduced time limits for appeal and decisions on appeal, with the effect that certain cases are dealt with in an accelerated manner. For the purpose of this report, these are referred to as accelerated procedures.

Under Article 27 AsylG, an accelerated procedure is applied where:

During the admissibility procedure, the BFA has notified the applicant of its intention to reject the application as inadmissible (see section on Admissibility Procedure) or dismiss the application on the merits;[1]
The appeal procedure is to be discontinued where the asylum seeker has absconded the procedure and a return decision was issued by the BFA;[2]
The BFA determines that the application should be rejected as inadmissible or dismissed on the merits and there is a public interest in accelerating the procedure.[3] Public interest exists in particular, albeit not exhaustively, where an applicant:[4]
Has committed a criminal offence;
Has been charged with a criminal offence by the Department of Public Prosecution;
Has been subject to pre-trial detention; or
Has been caught in the act of committing a criminal offence.
In case a “procedure for the imposition of measures to terminate residence” has been initiated, a decision on the asylum application shall be taken as quickly as possible and no later than 3 months.[5]

In addition, Article 27a AsylG provides an accelerated procedure as such and states that certain cases may be decided within 5 months, with a possible extension if necessary for the adequate assessment of the case. Such accelerated procedures are foreseen when grounds for denying the suspensive effect of appeals apply, as stated in Article 18 BFA-VG. These reasons are:

The asylum seeker comes from a safe country of origin;
There are indications that the asylum seeker endangers public security and order;
The asylum seeker has provided false statements on their identity, nationality and authenticity of documents;
No reasons for persecution have been asserted;
Statements adduced are obviously false or contradictory;
An executable return decision has been issued before applying for international protection; and
The asylum seeker refuses to provide fingerprints.[6]
Procedures are also subject to stricter time limits in case the asylum application is examined at the airport (see section Border Procedure).

By law, no vulnerable groups are automatically exempted from accelerated procedures. There is no information available as to a general practice on the matter.

In 2020, 524 applications were subject to an accelerated procedure with an average duration of less than 72 hours. Another 283 procedures were conducted as classic fast track procedures with an average duration of 22.7 days.[7] In accelerated procedures, the authorities focus on applicants from countries with a low recognition rate. In 2020, the top three nationalities to be confronted with accelerated procedures were Morocco (55%), Algeria (18%) and India (5.8%).[8] In 2021, 1,100 cases were channelled into the accelerated procedure. In 2022, 23,297 decisions were taken in a fast track procedure, among which 1,188 were taken in an accelerated procedure. The top three nationalities concerned were India (30%), Tunisia (29%) and Morocco (17%). In 2023, 8,421 decisions were taken in a fast track procedure, among which 300 were taken in an accelerated procedure. The top three nationalities processes in fast track procedures were Morocco (84%), India (16%) and Pakistan (9%).[9] These procedures are not necessarily conducted at the border.[10]

Personal interview
All asylum seekers must conduct a personal interview. The law permits an exception in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure.[11] If the facts are established, failure by the BFA or by the Federal Administrative Court to conduct an interview should not preclude the rendering of a decision. No differences are observed from the Regular Procedure: Personal Interview.

The BFA may omit the personal interviews in cases of subsequent applications which aim to prevent the execution of an expulsion order and/or subsequent applications without de facto protection against deportation. Subsequent applications within 18 days of the deportation date have no suspensive effect, the expulsion order issued after the rejection of the first asylum application can be executed.[12]

 

Appeal
Time limits for appeals are the same as in the Regular Procedure: Appeal. The BVwG has to decide on the appeal within 3 months in cases granted suspensive effect.[13] The BVwG has to decide on the appeal against negative decisions – which include expulsion orders – within 8 weeks.[14]

In subsequent applications without protection against deportation, the court has to decide within 8 weeks if suspensive effect was not granted. This provision has not much effect in practice, however, as asylum seekers may have been expelled or transferred before. Nevertheless, the appeal may have suspensive effect.[15]

Difficulties in lodging an appeal against negative decisions in the accelerated procedure are similar to those described in the section on the Dublin Procedure: Appeal; especially regarding the lack of free legal assistance. Organisations contracted to provide legal assistance also have to organise interpreters if necessary.

Legal assistance
Access to free legal assistance at first instance is difficult for asylum seekers detained during the accelerated procedure, although they may contact NGOs for advice. Free legal assistance is available for subsequent asylum applications too.[16] Since January 2021, the Federal Agency (BBU-GmbH) is responsible for providing legal assistance also in these cases.

A right to legal advice – as required by the recast Asylum Procedures Directive – is only mandatory at second instance, i.e. before the BVwG. This means that, at first instance, legal assistance will only be provided depending on existing resources of the Federal Agency.[17] As a result, it is not guaranteed that asylum applicants in the accelerated procedure will have effective access to legal assistance. Moreover, while they are in principle allowed to access other NGOs, the restriction on their freedom of movement in the context of the admissibility procedure (see Freedom of movement) significantly limits their access to NGOs which are not present in certain initial reception centres.

In so-called accelerated procedures under Article 27a AsylG in conjunction with Article 18 BFA-VG, mandatory free legal aid for the admissibility procedure is circumvented by the possibility to forward the procedure to the BFA branch office without prior admission to the regular procedure. This practice took place from time to time in 2018 but has not been reported recently. When asylum seekers get an invitation to their interview, they are still subject to restrictions on their freedom of movement. Therefore they are not able to consult NGOs or lawyers outside the restricted area. The BBU GmbH had access to accelerated procedure applicants. However, they were not allowed to share information on the concrete circumstances due to their legal obligations set out in the BBU-G.

# Admissibility procedure
ADMISSIBILITY PROCEDURE:
General (scope, criteria, time limits)

The admissibility procedure starts upon registration of the application with the first interrogation (Erstbefragung) of the asylum seeker by the public security officer, who has to submit a report to the branch office of the BFA. The caseworker of the BFA in charge of the case informs the police about the next steps of the admissibility procedure within 24 hours on average. If the applicant is admitted to the regular procedure they are ordered to travel to the initial reception centre (EAST) or transferred there by the police.[1] There are three EAST which are responsible for the admissibility procedure: one is located in Traiskirchen near Vienna, one in Thalham in Upper Austria and one at the Airport Vienna Schwechat. If the asylum applicant is not admitted to the regular procedure, they stay in the Federal reception system and are not being allocated to one of the provinces. The person has then only the right to stay in the district where the Federal reception centre is located.

All asylum seekers have to undergo the admissibility procedure, except children born in Austria whose parents have received protection status in the country or whose application is admitted to the regular procedure. Their applications are admitted immediately to the regular procedure.[2]

An application may be rejected as inadmissible for the following reasons:

The person comes from a safe third country;[3]
The person enjoys asylum in an EEA country or Switzerland;[4]
Another country is responsible for the application under the Dublin III Regulation;[5]
The person files a subsequent application and “no change significant to the decision has occurred in the material facts”.[6]
Asylum seekers receive a green “procedure card” within 3 days, which is an indication that their stay in Austria is tolerated. This card is replaced by a “white card” as soon as the application is admitted to the regular procedure.

Within 20 days after the application for international protection has been lodged, the BFA must admit the asylum applicant to the in-merit procedure or notify them formally by procedural order about the intention to issue an inadmissibility decision on the ground that another state is considered responsible for the examination of the asylum claim; or that it intends to revoke the suspensive effect of a subsequent application. If the BFA does not notify the asylum applicant of its intention to issue an inadmissibility decision within 20 days, the application is thus admitted to the regular procedure. This time limit does not apply if consultations with another state on the application of the Dublin III Regulation take place.[7]

The 20-day time limit shall not apply if the BFA intends to reject the application for international protection and the applicant does not cooperate during the asylum procedure. The procedure is deemed no longer relevant, especially if the asylum seeker absconded from the procedure.[8] The duty of asylum seekers to cooperate includes the duty to provide the BFA with information and evidence about their identity and reasons for applying for international protection, to be present at hearings and personal interviews as well as to inform the authorities about their address. If the asylum seeker is unable to cooperate during the procedure for reasons relating to their person (e.g. illness, postponing the interview due to duty to comply with summons etc.), the 20-day time limit shall be suspended.[9]

If the BFA has ordered an age assessment, the 20-day time limit also does not apply.[10]

As a result of the admissibility procedure, the application may either be admitted to the regular procedure, dismissed on the merits, or asylum or subsidiary protection status may be granted. The granting of a status or the dismissal of the application in the admissibility procedure replaces the admissibility decision.[11] An admissible application shall nevertheless be rejected if facts justifying such a rejection decision become known after the application was admitted.[12] In practice, this provision is applied in Dublin cases without the precondition that the facts justifying admissibility were not known before.[13]

The information provided by the Ministry of Interior did not include the number of inadmissibility decisions issued in 2019.[14] However, the admissibility procedure lasted for approximatively five days in 2018. This did not significantly change in 2019. It should be noted that, especially in the context of family proceedings, the admission often already takes place on the day of the application, which importantly reduces the calculation of the average duration.[15] It should be further noted that, during the admission procedure, asylum seekers are given basic care in federal care facilities. In 2020, asylum seekers were accommodated in federal facilities and received federal basic care for around 26 days on average.[16] In 2021, the average time of a person (separate data for asylum seekers not available) accommodated in federal basic care is 80 days, compared to 1,033 days in province basic care.[17] As of September 2023, the average time of a person’s accommodation in federal basic care is 123 days (2022: 153 days), compared to 622 days in province basic care (2022: 528 days).[18]

Personal interview
A personal interview is required by law. The asylum seeker is interrogated by law enforcement officials at the registration stage of the application for international protection and a second time by officials of the BFA during the admissibility procedure at the initial reception centre. The police are not allowed to ask detailed questions on the merits of the application such as the specific reasons for fleeing the country of origin or residence. There is a clear division of tasks between the police – which has the duty to assess the identity, personal data and the travel route of the applicant – and the officials of the BFA for assessing the facts on which the application is based. In reality, this sometimes leads to problems: the last question in the questionnaire of the police always concerns the reason why the person had to flee. In most cases, the applicants are told to give a short answer only and more details in a later interview. As a result, the reasons for fleeing the country of origin may be found not credible at the interview stage before the officials of the BFA if the asylum seeker has based the application for international protection on other reasons than those stated immediately upon arrival at the police stage. There is jurisprudence by the High Administrative Court that the evidence gathered in the initial interview at the police shall not be used in an ”unreflective manner” by the authorities and the Court as the initial interview does not focus on the reasons why the person is seeking international protection.[19]

In this regard, Article 19(4) AsylG explicitly foresees that, in the admission procedure, the asylum seeker shall also be informed that their own statements will be accorded particular attention, meaning that they should be aware of the consequences of false testimonies.

The law allows for an exception from the personal interview in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure while being accommodated in the initial reception centre. If the facts relevant to a decision on an asylum claim are established, the fact that the asylum seeker has not been interviewed yet by the BFA or by the BVwG shall not preclude the rendering of a decision. In practice this exception is not applied very often, however. The BFA files most of these cases as “discontinued”, which means that upon request by the asylum seekers the procedure will be reopened. An exception may apply in a subsequent asylum application that was submitted within two days before the execution of an expulsion order.[20] An interview during the admission procedure may be dispensed with if the procedure is admitted.

 

Appeal
For the admissibility procedure, the appeal stages are the same as in the regular procedure. The time limits within which an appeal against the BFA’s inadmissibility decision must be lodged is two weeks and the appeal has in general no suspensive effect, except when decided otherwise by the BVwG.[21]

As a first step, the BVwG decides within one week after receiving the appeal whether the appeal will have suspensive effect during the continuing appeal procedure. If the BVwG does not grant a suspensive effect to the appeal or does not admit the appeal after seven days, the asylum applicant can be transferred to the responsible Member State, the safe third country or their country of origin in case of a subsequent application.

If the application is rejected on the merits in the admissibility procedure and the second instance grants suspensive effect after the appeal was brought in, the granting of suspensive effect also means that the application has been admitted in Austria.[22]

Appeals against a decision rejecting the asylum application as inadmissible do not have suspensive effect unless this is granted by the BVwG.[23] The reasons for not granting suspensive effect to the appeal in inadmissible cases correspond to grounds for declaring claims manifestly unfounded, as mentioned in Regular Procedure: Appeal.

The appointed legal adviser is not obliged to help the asylum seeker to draft the complaint, despite the fact that it must be written in German, and the requested qualification for legal advisers is also not sufficient.

 

Legal assistance
The BBU GmbH as legal adviser is automatically appointed by the BFA in case it intends to reject the application in the framework of the admissibility procedure and if an interview is to be conducted within 72 hours of handing over a procedural order of its intention to reject the application in the admissibility procedure. Legal advice has to be provided at least 24 hours before the second interview, the one with the BFA, during which the asylum seeker is given the opportunity to be heard. If the interview is conducted within 72 hours, presence of legal advisers during the interview is mandatory unless the applicant dismisses the advisor explicitly. If the interview is conducted more than 72 hours after, the BBU will not even be informed of the case until a negative decision is issued.

Free legal advice is foreseen for subsequent asylum applications under the same conditions (interview within 72 hours) as well, including at appeal stage.[24] Most of the cases that are regarded as inadmissible are Dublin cases (see Dublin: Legal Assistance) and Safe Third Country cases.

Since January 2021, legal assistance has been provided by the new Federal Agency, the BBU GmbH (see Regular procedure: Legal assistance).

 

Suspension of returns for beneficiaries of protection in another Member State
There is no general suspension of returns of beneficiaries of protection to any EU member state. In practice, there are mainly cases of Afghan and Syrian nationals with a protection status in either Greece or Bulgaria.

Rejections for existing protection in another EU state are also issued regularly by the BFA concerning countries such as Greece or Hungary, even though the appeal is regularly granted suspensive effect.

Hungary: In a case of a Syrian national who has received subsidiary protection status in Hungary in 2015 and applied for asylum in Austria in 2020, the BVwG rejected the applicant’s appeal.[25] Even though the applicant brought forward that he had no access to support from the state, had to live on the street and was assaulted the Court came to the conclusion that there exist support possibilities from the government and from NGOS and that there is no real-risk of an Art 3 ECHR violation.

Greece: There is no general policy of suspension of transfers of BIPs to Greece. Applications by beneficiaries of international protection in Greece have risen since 2020. While the first instance authority initially admitted vulnerable cases to the asylum procedure, a change of strategy was observed throughout 2021. Until then, in general, in single cases where protection status was granted by Greek authorities, the Courts rejected applications lodged in Austria. This changed in June 2021 as the Constitutional Court ruled that, due to inadequate reception conditions in Greece a thorough assessment has to be carried out before transferring beneficiaries of international protection back to Greece.[26] the Constitutional Court suspended the decision of the Federal administrative court which had rejected an appeal from an Afghan woman who received asylum status in Greece in 2019 and applied for asylum in Austria in 2020. Looking at the recently updated AIDA country report on Greece, the Constitutional Court considered that the applicant may face a risk of violation of Art 3 ECHR violation and ordered further examinations on the access to food, shelter and sanitary facilities. The decision set out a benchmark as it was done in plenary of the Constitutional Court. Following this decision, the BVwG reconsidered several first instance decisions based on insufficient information on the situation in Greece.[27] A project called “Tetraa” was initiated by asylkoordination together with Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst and lawyer Christian Schmaus. In this project, strategic litigation is being conducted focusing on asylum procedures of beneficiaries of International protection in Greece coming to Austria applying for asylum because of dire living conditions in Greece.[28]

There is an examination of the individual cases and communication with the Greek authorities.  However, in at least one case a person who had received subsidiary protection in Greece and whose application was rejected in Austria, was deported to Greece in 2022.[29] There was no transfer in 2023. In the particular case of 2022, the case is still pending at the Constitutional Court in Austria at the time of writing.

Also in 2023, the Constitutional Court upheld the appeals in two cases due to lack of investigations concerning access to basic care systems[30] and in a case of a pregnant applicant with a recognised refugee status in Greece.[31] The Federal Administrative Court had wrongly based the rejection of the applications on the fact that the applicant is based in Austria due to her residence permit and will not be transferred to GR anyway. Therefore the decision would be a “purely hypothetical “Return” act. The Constitutional Court found that the general reference to the reporting situation is insufficient.

Bulgaria: There is also some case-law regarding beneficiaries of international protection in Bulgaria who come to Austria to lodge a new application. In 2016, a Syrian mother with 3 children gave birth after she arrived in Bulgaria where she suffered from prenatal depression. She was granted subsidiary protection in Bulgaria shortly after moving to Austria. The Bulgarian authorities denied responsibility under the Dublin system, but were ready to take over as a result of the readmission agreement. The BVwG considered the deportation to Bulgaria as not permissible because of the PTSD from which the children were suffering and which was triggered, among other things, by experiences during the imprisonment in Bulgaria at the end of September 2015, as well as the intensive family relationship with relatives living in Austria.[32] In 2023, the BVwG granted suspensive effect in several cases concerning Bulgaria and appeals were upheld as the investigations of the first instance concerning living conditions were not thorough enough.[33]

The BVwG has also accepted an appeal of an Afghan family in 2017 who had received subsidiary protection in Hungary, due to the need to clarify whether the current situation of beneficiaries of protection in Hungary raises a risk of violation of Article 3 ECHR.[34] In the case of a single Syrian who obtained subsidiary protection in Bulgaria, however, the BVwG found no real risk on the ground that he did not belong to a vulnerable group.[35]

# Accelerated procedure
ACCELERATED PROCEDURE:
General (scope, grounds for accelerated procedures, time limits)

The law provides for “procedures for the imposition of measures to terminate residence” subject to reduced time limits for appeal and decisions on appeal, with the effect that certain cases are dealt with in an accelerated manner. For the purpose of this report, these are referred to as accelerated procedures.

Under Article 27 AsylG, an accelerated procedure is applied where:

During the admissibility procedure, the BFA has notified the applicant of its intention to reject the application as inadmissible (see section on Admissibility Procedure) or dismiss the application on the merits;[1]
The appeal procedure is to be discontinued where the asylum seeker has absconded the procedure and a return decision was issued by the BFA;[2]
The BFA determines that the application should be rejected as inadmissible or dismissed on the merits and there is a public interest in accelerating the procedure.[3] Public interest exists in particular, albeit not exhaustively, where an applicant:[4]
Has committed a criminal offence;
Has been charged with a criminal offence by the Department of Public Prosecution;
Has been subject to pre-trial detention; or
Has been caught in the act of committing a criminal offence.
In case a “procedure for the imposition of measures to terminate residence” has been initiated, a decision on the asylum application shall be taken as quickly as possible and no later than 3 months.[5]

In addition, Article 27a AsylG provides an accelerated procedure as such and states that certain cases may be decided within 5 months, with a possible extension if necessary for the adequate assessment of the case. Such accelerated procedures are foreseen when grounds for denying the suspensive effect of appeals apply, as stated in Article 18 BFA-VG. These reasons are:

The asylum seeker comes from a safe country of origin;
There are indications that the asylum seeker endangers public security and order;
The asylum seeker has provided false statements on their identity, nationality and authenticity of documents;
No reasons for persecution have been asserted;
Statements adduced are obviously false or contradictory;
An executable return decision has been issued before applying for international protection; and
The asylum seeker refuses to provide fingerprints.[6]
Procedures are also subject to stricter time limits in case the asylum application is examined at the airport (see section Border Procedure).

In 2020, 524 applications were subject to an accelerated procedure with an average duration of less than 72 hours. Another 283 procedures were conducted as classic fast track procedures with an average duration of 22.7 days.[7] In accelerated procedures, the authorities focus on applicants from countries with a low recognition rate. In 2020, the top three nationalities to be confronted with accelerated procedures were Morocco (55%), Algeria (18%) and India (5.8%).[8] In 2021, 1,100 cases were channeled into the accelerated procedure. In 2022, 23,297 decisions were taken in a fast track procedure, among which 1,188 were taken in an accelerated procedure.  The top three nationalities concerned were India (30%), Tunisia (29%) and Morocco (17%). These procedures are not necessarily conducted at the border.[9]

 

Personal interview

All asylum seekers must conduct a personal interview. The law permits an exception in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure.[10] If the facts are established, failure by the BFA or by the Federal Administrative Court to conduct an interview should not preclude the rendering of a decision. No differences are observed from the Regular Procedure: Personal Interview.

The BFA may omit the personal interviews in cases of subsequent applications which aim to prevent the execution of an expulsion order and/or subsequent applications without de facto protection against deportation. Subsequent applications within 18 days of the deportation date have no suspensive effect, the expulsion order issued after the rejection of the first asylum application can be executed.[11]

 

Appeal

Time limits for appeals are the same as in the Regular Procedure: Appeal. The BVwG has to decide on the appeal within 3 months in cases granted suspensive effect.[12] The BVwG has to decide on the appeal against negative decisions – which include expulsion orders – within 8 weeks.[13]

In subsequent applications without protection against deportation, the court has to decide within 8 weeks if suspensive effect was not granted. This provision has not much effect in practice, however, as asylum seekers may have been expelled or transferred before. Nevertheless, the appeal may have suspensive effect.[14]

Difficulties in lodging an appeal against negative decisions in the accelerated procedure are similar to those described in the section on the Dublin Procedure: Appeal; especially regarding the lack of free legal assistance. Organisations contracted to provide legal assistance also have to organise interpreters if necessary.

 

Legal assistance

Access to free legal assistance at first instance is difficult for asylum seekers detained during the accelerated procedure, although they may contact NGOs for advice. Free legal assistance is available for subsequent asylum applications too.[15] Since January 2021, the Federal Agency (BBU-GmbH) is responsible for providing legal assistance also in these cases.

A right to legal advice – as required by the recast Asylum Procedures Directive – is only mandatory at second instance, i.e. before the BVwG. This means that, at first instance, legal assistance will only be provided depending on existing resources of the Federal Agency.[16] As a result, it is not guaranteed that asylum applicants in the accelerated procedure will have effective access to legal assistance. Moreover, while they are in principle allowed to access other NGOs, the restriction on their freedom of movement in the context of the admissibility procedure significantly limits their access to NGOs which are not present in certain initial reception centres.

In so-called accelerated procedures under Article 27a AsylG in conjunction with Article 18 BFA-VG, mandatory free legal aid for the admissibility procedure is circumvented by the possibility to forward the procedure to the BFA branch office without prior admission to the regular procedure. This practice took place from time to time in 2018 but has not been reported recently. When asylum seekers get an invitation to their interview, they are still subject to restrictions on their freedom of movement. Therefore they are not able to consult NGOs or lawyers outside the restricted area. The BBU GmbH had access to accelerated procedure applicants. However, they were not allowed to share information on the concrete circumstances due to their legal obligations set out in the BBU-G.

# Dublin procedure
DUBLIN Austria:
General

Dublin statistics: 2023

As of December 2023, Austria carried out 1,240 (2022: 1,100) outgoing Dublin transfers and received 2,166 (2022: 1,575) incoming transfers.[1] In 2023, the main countries receiving outgoing transfers from Austria were Germany (24%), Croatia (21%) and Romania (12%).[2]

In December 2022 Italy announced a temporary stop of Dublin transfers to Italy due to “technical reasons”. There is no official information as to when Dublin transfers to Italy will resume.[3] In 2023, no transfers to Italy took place.

Application of the Dublin criteria
If the special regulation due to threats to public security and order comes into effect (see Access to the Territory), third-country nationals will be returned to neighbouring countries. Since it will not be possible to lodge an asylum application, this will completely contravene the Dublin system.[4]

Austria applies the Dublin procedure systematically and, where it proves impossible to transfer an asylum seeker to one country, examines the criteria of the Regulation to determine whether the person can be sent to another country.[5]

Documentation and entry

The Dublin Regulation may be triggered if there is a so-called “Eurodac hit”, i.e. if the asylum applicant has obtained a visa from another Member State, if the asylum applicant admits that they entered the EU via another Member State or if there is a suspicion or circumstantial evidence indicating the asylum applicant entered via another Member State. Although there are other grounds applicable for determining a Member State’s responsibility under the Dublin III Regulation, these are the most common grounds applied in Austria.

After the CJEU ruling in Jafari,[6] which found that the state-organised transit through the Western Balkan route in 2015-2016 qualified as “illegal entry” under Article 13 of the Regulation, the VwGH dismissed the appeal against a transfer to Croatia on those grounds. The Court did not indicate that Austria applied the discretionary clauses in these cases.[7]

In a case concerning a person who transited through Bulgaria and following a short stay travelled to Serbia and then entered Hungary, without applying for asylum in any of these countries, the Administrative High Court ruled that the provisions of Article 13(1) in conjunction with Article 19(2) of the Dublin III Regulation and in the light of the A.S. ruling of the CJEU, can only be understood as meaning that the criterion of illegal entry, as defined in Article 13(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, is applicable if the asylum seeker did not apply for international protection in that Member State, but if that application was made in another Member State after a short-term voluntary exit to a third country. Bulgaria was therefore deemed responsible for the asylum application.[8]

Family unity

The BFA has put forward surprising arguments in the context of family reunification under the Dublin Regulation. In a case of an unaccompanied minor to whom a protection was granted in Austria, the Greek Asylum Service submitted a “take charge” request for the parents to be transferred from Greece to Austria. The BFA refused responsibility on the ground that the parents had deliberately accepted the separation from their minor child. The rejection of such requests is not considered a formal decision which may be legally challenged before the BVwG. Requests from Greece are also handled very slowly and take often more than a year, which is why Austria ends up being responsible for the asylum application by default. In 2022 Austria received 39 take back and take-charge requests from the Greek Dublin Unit, out of which 14 were accepted. Moreover, a total of 14 transfers were carried out (including transfers pending from the year before).[9] According to Eurostat as reported by Austria, Austria received 44 requests from Greece, including 22 take charge requests and 22 take back requests. Austria decided on 51 requests, potentially including some sent in 2022: 28 take charge and 23 take back requests were accepted. However, only 3 transfers took place in 2023, two based on article 8 (unaccompanied minor with a family member legally present in Austria), and one based on the humanitarian clause.

In 2017, the VwGH examined the question of whether an unaccompanied child could stay in Austria, whilst Italy had been determined as responsible for his family members. Whereas the BVwG had referred to the sovereignty clause of Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation in order to prevent a violation of the right to private and family life, the VwGH stated that Article 11 of the Dublin Regulation prevailed in order to ensure the unity of the family and the best interests of the child.[10]

In 2018, the BvWG had to rule on a case of family reunification concerning parents that had applied for asylum in Austria, while their minor child and the grandmother had applied for asylum in Greece. In accordance with the Dublin III Regulation, Greece requested Austria to be responsible for the applications. However, the BFA had doubts on whether family reunification would be in the best interests of the child and refused to take responsibility. The BVwG confirmed the rejection of the BFA. In the case of refusal of family reunification, the only available option for the requesting Member State is to request a re-examination. As regards the asylum applicant, they cannot act directly against the negative decision nor bring it to appeal, as this is a purely intergovernmental procedure. Therefore, in this case, it was the responsibility of Greece as the requesting Member State to challenge Austria’s refusal to grant family reunification. The revision was rejected by the High Administrative Court.[11]

As a consequence of two cases that asylkoordination österreich had put forward to the Ombudsman, the Minister of Interior and the Ombudsman agreed that the BFA should involve the Child and Youth Welfare Agency when it examines family reunification requests under the Dublin III Regulation to UAMs living in Austria.[12] No changes have been noted in practice, however.[13]

In January 2021, a deportation of a family to Georgia in the middle of the night was debated publicly. One girl was born in Austria and resided in the country over ten years. The case shed light on the fact that children’s rights are often not taken into account in asylum procedures and decisions. The Ministry of Justice introduced a Child Welfare Commission headed by former presidential candidate Irmgrad Griss to evaluate the implementation of children’s rights in asylum procedures.[14] The Commission presented an elaborated report in July 2021 with many recommendations on how the best interest of the child could be guaranteed better in the asylum process, including reception conditions and Dublin III assessment. Recommendations for improvements were presented.[15] In July 2022, the former member of the Commission made a press conference in which they announced that an evaluation done by Asylkoordination, and the Vienna Refugee Law Clinic shows that improvement in practice is still very poor, recommendations are neglected by the authorities. They also demanded the introduction of a permanent monitoring board concerning children’s rights in Austria.[16]

To demonstrate family ties, every asylum applicant must have mentioned the existence of other family members during asylum procedure, in Austria as well as in the other Member States where they have applied for asylum. Marriage certificates or birth certificates are required on a regular basis. Depending on the country of origin, these documents are surveyed by the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation to prove authenticity. Austria requires the original documents, where available, to be sent for verification and does not leave such verification to the other Member States.

DNA tests may be required to provide proof of family ties, but this is rare in practice. DNA tests have to be paid by the asylum seeker. If a DNA test has been suggested[17] by the BFA or the Administrative Court and family links have been verified, asylum seekers may demand a refund of the costs from the BFA. The issue of DNA tests was discussed in the context of a legislative reform affecting Family Reunification but was ultimately not included in the reform.[18]

The High Administrative Court ruled in December 2022 concerning the responsibility of a state for family members: Article 9 of the Dublin III Regulation contains special jurisdiction for family members of beneficiaries of international protection. If the applicant has a family member – regardless of whether the family already existed in the country of origin – who is a beneficiary of international protection and has the right to reside in a Member State, that Member State is responsible for examining the application for international protection, provided that the persons concerned express this wish in writing. This regulation not only allows the persons concerned (the applicant and the beneficiaries of international protection) to have a say, but gives them the power to decide whether they want to be reunited. These rules out the possibility that people are brought together against their will. The applicant must be informed of the requirement for such declarations within the framework of their right to information (cf. Art. 4 Para. 1 lit. b and c Dublin III Regulation) and, in the event of such a request by the applicant, it must be verified that the beneficiaries of the international protection agree to a reunification.[19]

Unaccompanied children

Following the judgment of the CJEU in M.A. which concerned Article 8(4) of the Dublin III Regulation,[20] for asylum applications lodged by unaccompanied children, the BFA has ordered age assessments even in cases where there are no reasons for doubts in regard to the age of the asylum seeker.

In one case concerning a transfer to Hungary, the BFA considered that the deadline for replying to a request should be suspended until an age assessment is conducted. The VwGH disagreed, however, and ruled that the deadline had expired.[21] In 2018, there was another case related to the deadline for replying to a transfer request. In accordance with Article 21 (1) of the Dublin III Regulation, a request for transfer had been send to Croatia. Although the request was incomplete as it was missing the results of the medical age assessment of the child, the BFA considered that the available information was sufficient to conclude that the asylum seeker was an adult. However, the six-month transfer period was not triggered until the age report was received and Austria was therefore deemed responsible for the application.[22]

The VwGH further had to rule on a Dublin transfer to Bulgaria. The case concerned two brothers, one of whom was still a minor. Given that Bulgaria was already responsible for the asylum application of the older brother, the BFA concluded that Bulgaria should also be responsible for the asylum application of the minor, in compliance with the principle of family unity as defined in Article 20(3) of the Dublin III Regulation. The BFA had further assumed the minority of the younger brother without conducting any age assessment. The BVwG overturned the decision and stated that Art. 8(4) applied to the accompanied minor and that, subsequently, the adult was allowed to stay on the Austrian territory in accordance with Art. 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation. However, the VwGH followed the BFA and the adult’s asylum application was rejected in first instance, on the grounds that Bulgaria remained responsible for that application.[23]

The dependent persons and discretionary clauses
Dependent persons

During a Dublin procedure with Italy, the Federal Administrative Court emphasised that Articles 16 (Dependent persons) and 17 (Discretionary clauses) of the Dublin III Regulation determine separate requirements and cannot be reduced to the meaning of Article 8 ECHR. Italy agreed to the Austrian request to take charge of the asylum application only after Austria expressed strong objections due to the fact that Italy had already issued a Schengen visa. The concerned asylum seeker in question was from Chechen origin and aged over 60 years old. He also suffered from a serious illness and a disability which suggested that he relied on support from his son who is legally residing in Austria. The Administrative Court found the decision unlawful and reverted the case back to the first instance authority because Article 16(1) of the Regulation had not been sufficiently considered by that authority. The Court noted, in addition, that Article 17(2) could also be relevant in this case because, due to the Chechen culture, the support of the son for his old parents is more likely to be accepted than foreign support.[24]

This argumentation can be found in another decision of the Court in the case of a single Afghan mother who applied for asylum with a small child and a new-born baby. She had been raped and was suicidal. The judgment held that the authorities should examine which female relatives, living in Austria as recognised refugees, could support her by taking care of the children. Furthermore, the help of females of a family among themselves could be preferred to foreign support based on the applicant’s cultural background.[25] The same argumentation led to the withdrawal of a Dublin decision regarding an Egyptian asylum seeker whose sister required support for her five under-age children after the death of her husband.[26]

A further Dublin decision was regarded as unlawful because a Chechen asylum seeker attempted suicide for the second time after enactment of the notice of transfer to Poland. Therefore, her demand for care and the willingness of her sister, who is living in Austria with refugee status, to take care of her should be examined. Due to the recommendation by a specialist to refrain from a transfer to Poland, it would also be a possibility to make use of the sovereignty clause.[27]

In another case, the BVwG referred to the wording of Art.16(1) of the Dublin III regulation on dependent persons to conclude that this provision also applied to cases in which the asylum applicant provides support to a family member (in the present case, an older brother providing support to his minor sister with special needs). In addition, the Court noted that no investigation on the special needs of the minor was undertaken by the BFA and considered that the responsibility of Italy would breach the ECHR given the particular circumstances of the case.[28]

Humanitarian clause

Austrian authorities make reference to this clause mostly in cases where the asylum applicant is still in another country and applies for reunification with relatives in Austria.

Sovereignty clause

As of August 2023, article 17 Dublin-VO III was applied in 31 cases (2022: 14).[29]

In principle, an asylum seeker has the legal right to request the asylum authorities to implement the sovereignty clause, although this is not specifically laid down in law. The Constitutional Court has ruled, on the basis of case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), that even in case of responsibility of another Member State under the Dublin Regulation, the Austrian authorities are nevertheless bound by the ECHR.[30] This means that, in case of a risk of a human rights violation, Austria has a duty to use the sovereignty clause. This decision is applicable according to Articles 2 and 3 ECHR as well as Article 8 ECHR following an interpretation consistent with the constitution.

However, the assessment of a risk of a human rights violation allowing the use of the sovereignty clause needs be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably delay the examination of the asylum application. The principle that admissibility procedures should not last too long was reflected in a decision of the Administrative Court. A Chechen family had applied for asylum in Poland, Austria and Switzerland by submitting consecutive applications since 2005. One family member was severely traumatised. Switzerland decided on the merits of the case and issued a deportation order before they re-entered Austria. The Court reverted the procedure back to the BFA. The Court found that it would have been necessary to ask for the details of the procedure in Switzerland to prevent indirect violations of Article 3 ECHR through chain deportation. For one family member, the risk of suicide was obvious according to expert statements. The Court, referring to the judgment of the CJEU in the case of NS & ME,[31] held that the long duration of the admissibility procedure has to be taken into consideration when determining the Member State responsible for examining the asylum application and that applying a return procedure in such cases might be more effective.[32]

The sovereignty clause has to be applied in the case of vulnerable asylum seekers to prevent violations of Article 3 ECHR (Article 4 EU Charter). In the case of a refugee from Syria who arrived in Italy in 2013, where he was fingerprinted, but immediately continued to Austria, the Administrative Court agreed that the situation in his country of origin as well as his personal state of stress and uncertainty regarding the situation of his wife and three small children led to an exceptional psychological state with the consequence of several stays in hospital.[33]

In a ruling of January 2017 concerning the transfer of a family including two children to Croatia, the BVwG found that it was irrelevant that the adult brother was not legally responsible for the custody of his minor siblings. As the separation of the adult brother from his minor siblings would constitute an unacceptable interference with the right to family life and the children’s well-being, the application of the sovereignty clause was ordered.[34]

In December 2017, the BFA successfully appealed a decision of the BVwG concerning an unaccompanied child who had been allowed to remain in Austria under the sovereignty clause, while his younger brother was in Bulgaria. The VwGH ruled that the use of the sovereignty clause to prevent a violation of Article 8 ECHR presupposes a correct determination of Austria’s responsibility. The Court found that, if the close relationship between the two brothers would result in Austria not being responsible for the application of the elder brother, then the reference to the sovereignty clause by the BVwG to prevent an Article 8 ECHR violation lacked legal basis.[35]

In another case, the BFA appealed to the VwGH against a decision to transfer a Chechen family to Poland, where the father had already applied and passed the admissibility procedure in Austria. The VwGH found that the applications of the spouse and children should be admitted and the sovereignty clause used in order to preserve family unity.[36]

In several cases, the BVwG has argued that the sovereignty clause may only be applied where a third-country national has lodged an asylum application.

In 2018, Austria made use of the sovereignty clause and accepted to be responsible for the asylum application of a Georgian national, for whom the Czech Republic was initially responsible as she had obtained a visa there. Given that she was the legal guardian of her husband who has special needs and who has obtained the subsidiary protection in Austria, the Court concluded that the asylum seeker should not be separated from her husband and referred to Article 16 of the Dublin regulation on dependent persons as well as to Article 8 ECHR on the right to a private and family life.[37]

Another case in which Austria made use of the sovereignty clause in 2018 concerned a Russian asylum seeker and her two children, who were traveling from Moscow to Vienna. Given that she suffered from different serious illnesses (sclerosis and PTSD), that one of her underage children was mentally ill and that she had relatives in Austria, the BVwG considered that she should stay in Austria and benefit from their support, instead of going to Italy where no one could provide her adequate assistance.[38] In its reasoning, the Court paid particular attention to the child’s best interest (e.g. having adequate support in Austria and the presence of family members).

Moreover, the Constitutional Court held in 2018 that single parents with minor children are considered by Article 21 of the recast Reception Conditions Directive as vulnerable persons.[39] The case concerned an Afghan national and the refusal of the Federal Administrative Court to make use of the sovereignty clause. The latter had refused to recognise the existence of a marriage between the Afghan asylum seeker and her Afghan husband who had obtained the subsidiary protection in Austria, as they were married only under the shariah law in Pakistan. Although their child was born in Austria, the BvWG did not address the vulnerability of the single mother nor the one of the new-born child, despite the situation in Bulgaria as assessed in the AIDA report on Bulgaria (to which the BVwG had made reference).

In September 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled against a decision by BVwG in which the second instance found a planned transfer of a Syrian national to Malta to be admissible. The Syrian national claimed that he would be put in detention upon return to Malta and the conditions in detention in Malta would violate his rights guaranteed by Art 2, 3 ECHR. The BVwG did not assess the situation in detention in Malta and ignored the deterioration following the Covid-19 situation in Malta.[40]

Procedure
Austria has not passed any national legislation to incorporate the Dublin III Regulation, as it is directly applicable, but refers to it in Article 5 AsylG. This provision, together with Article 2(1)(8) BFA-VG, states that the authorities issue an inadmissibility decision when Austria is not responsible for conducting the asylum procedure based on the Dublin III Regulation.[41] In the same decision, the authorities have to declare which Member State is responsible for the examination of the asylum application on its merits.

The law also states that there should also be an inadmissibility decision in case another Member State is responsible for identifying which Member State is responsible for the examination of the asylum application on its merits, that is in cases where the applicant is no longer on Austrian territory.[42]

There are three initial reception centres (EAST) which are responsible for the admissibility procedure: one is located in Traiskirchen near Vienna, one is in Thalham in Upper Austria and one is at the Airport Vienna Schwechat. These centres are specialised in conducting outgoing Dublin procedures.

A central Dublin department in Vienna is responsible for supervising the work of the initial reception centres. Moreover, it conducts all Dublin procedures with regard to incoming Dublin requests (requests to Austria to take back or take charge an asylum seeker by another Member State) and, in response to a request of the Aliens Police department, all consultations with Member States concerning foreigners who have not applied for asylum.

Once an application for asylum is lodged, a preliminary interview by the police (Erstbefragung) takes place on the circumstances of entering Austria and the first country of entry in the EU, the personal data and – in a very brief manner – also on the reasons why an applicant left their home country. The applicant receives a copy of the report and is further fingerprinted and photographed. Fingerprints are taken from all asylum seekers older than 14 years of age. No problems have been reported with regard to the taking of fingerprints. In case an applicant refuses to be fingerprinted, the appeal against a negative decision may not benefit from suspensive effect,[43] but this is not relevant to the Dublin procedure. Due to the increase in applications in summer 2022, non-vulnerable applicants without EURODAC hits were not questioned right at the border but sent to another police directorate in different parts of Austria. The aim was to distribute the work of the police in the province close to Hungary, Burgenland, to other provinces. After the first months of 2023, the police returned to the normal procedure as the number of applications decreased significantly.

Since September 2018, the Aliens Police Department and the BFA are authorised to examine the data storage of persons applying for international protection. However, this interference with the right to privacy is only permitted if the identity or travel route cannot be established on the basis of available evidence. Until the end of 2022, phones and/or other devices containing data of applicants could not be examined by Austrian authorities due to the lack of necessary data protection measures and missing technical equipment.[44] As of September 2023, 16 data storage devices were seized and searched by the BFA .[45]

The asylum seeker receives a green “procedure card” after the public security officer has consulted the BFA about the further steps to be taken in the asylum procedure: admittance to the regular procedure or admissibility procedure. Asylum seekers are transferred or asked to go to the initial reception centres when a Dublin procedure is initiated. The green card permits the asylum seeker to stay in the district of the initial reception centre. Cards for asylum seekers – as well as those granted to beneficiaries of protection – should be designed in such a way that they are counterfeit-proof and have a contactless readable data option.

In every procedure, the BFA has to consider within the admissibility procedure whether an asylum seeker could find protection in a safe third country or another EU Member State or Schengen Associated State.

The VwGH has determined that the deadline for an outgoing request starts running from the registration of the application, i.e. the moment the BFA receives the report of the Erstbefragung, in line with the CJEU ruling in Mengesteab.[46] The case before the VwGH concerned delays in the Erstbefragung, as the asylum seeker had applied for asylum in November 2015 but the preliminary interview only took place in January 2016 and the request was issued in March 2016.

Every asylum seeker receives written information, usually through the form of leaflets, about the first steps in the asylum procedure, basic care, medical care and the Eurodac and Dublin III Regulation at the beginning of the procedure in the initial reception centres. No particular issue in the provision of information have been reported, although it is recommended that providing information orally on top of written information would help asylum seekers to understand the asylum system.

Within 20 calendar days after the application, the BFA has to either admit the asylum applicant to the in-merit procedure or inform the applicant formally – through procedural order – about the intention to issue an inadmissibility decision on the ground that another state is considered responsible for the examination of the asylum claim.[47] The same applies to so called fast-track in-merits procedures. After the requested Member State accepts responsibility, the asylum seeker is given the possibility to be heard. Before that interview, they have an appointment with a legal adviser who must be present at the interview and who can also access documents in the case file.[48] These tasks will be carried out by legal advisors of the BBU as of 2021.

Individualised guarantees
Individualised guarantees were still not requested systematically as of the end of 2020. Their content depends on the individual circumstances of each case according to the BFA. Already in 2017 it was demonstrated that individual guarantees are not requested for vulnerable persons, even where these are requested by legal advisers during the Dublin interview or the appeal before the BVwG. The authorities seem to deem it sufficient to request information from ACCORD or the State Documentation database, in specific cases e.g. access to medical treatment for cancer patients in Italy, and to base their decision thereon.

The sharing of information amongst Member State on the vulnerability and individual guarantees of asylum seekers is still not ensured. In the case of an Iraqi woman in a wheelchair, the BFA obtained a medical report confirming the availability of the necessary medical treatment in Italy. However, Italy had not been informed of the vulnerability in the first round of proceedings, which is why the BVwG granted the appeal and referred the case back to the BFA. The BVwG also rejected the rejection of the BFA in the second stage and stated that Austria was responsible for providing care to avoid a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR under the discretionary clause of Article 17 (1) of the Dublin III Regulation.[49]

Transfers
Transfers are normally carried out without the asylum applicant concerned being informed of the time and the location they are transferred to before the departure from Austria, giving them no possibility to return to the responsible Member State voluntarily.[50] There continue to be reports of the BFA informing receiving countries of a Dublin transfer on very short notice, in some cases no more than a week, even for asylum seekers requiring special care.[51] This raises questions with regard to Recital 24 and Article 26(2) Dublin III Regulation according to which a transfer decision must contain the details of the time carrying out the transfer and “if necessary, contain information on the place and date at which the applicant should appear, if he is travelling to the Member State responsible by their own means.”

In case of an enforced transfer to another EU Member State, the police first apprehend the asylum applicant and transfers them to a detention centre (see Detention of Asylum Seekers).[52] There is also a special detention centre for families in Vienna. The asylum applicant has to stay there until the deportation takes place, usually after one or two days. Under the Dublin procedure, asylum seekers can be held for up to 48 hours without detention being specifically ordered. As a less coercive measure, asylum seekers may be ordered to stay at a certain place (such as a flat or a reception centre).[53] Depending on the responsible state and the number of persons being transferred, the transfer takes place by plane, by bus or by police car under escort.

Regarding detention, the Administrative High Court has stated that the time limit for transfer, which is of 6 weeks, does not start running before the suspensive effect ceases. Furthermore, the period begins running only after the one-week period of the BVwG to award the suspensive effect of the complaint has expired.[54]

No figures on the average duration of the procedure are available. However, the minimum period for a decision to be issued, an appeal to be filed and suspensive effect to be decided upon would be six weeks.

In 2023, 1,240 Dublin-out transfers were conducted.[55] 2,166 Dublin-in transfers were completed in the same time period. As more than 30,000 cases were discontinued due to absconding to other countries, the share of Dublin transfers completed only represents a small part of the applicants. Around 8,000,000 discontinued cases concerned Afghan nationals.

 

Personal interview
After the initial registration process and interview by the police is concluded, another interview conducted by the BFA has to be conducted during admission phase.[56] The law allows for an exception in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure in the initial reception centre (EAST).[57] If the facts are established, and a decision can be taken, the fact that the asylum seeker has not been interviewed yet by BFA or by the BVwG shall not preclude the taking of a decision. In practice this exception is not applied very often.[58] Such relevant facts for a decision in Dublin cases could be a Eurodac hit and the acceptance of the requested Member State to take back the asylum seeker.

The reform of June 2019 establishing the BBU introduces a new threshold which grants the asylum applicant the right to free legal assistance by the Agency only if an appointment – during which the applicant exercises their right to be heard – is scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) after having been notified by the BFA of the intention to reject the asylum application. This means that, if the BFA grants the asylum applicant the right to be heard at a later stage (e.g. in 4 or 5 days), free legal assistance by the Agency will only be available if resources so allow.[59] In practice, the BBU GmbH is notified in some cases and asked to provide legal counselling. There is no official statistics on how many interviews are conducted within 72 hours but in most cases applicants do not have access to legal counselling in Dublin procedures. In practice, legal advisers are present when appointed. But they are often informed only shortly before the interview, which means that they lack time to study the file. In case of detention, legal advice to asylum seekers takes place immediately before the hearing in the detention centre.[60] The provision of § 29 (4) AsylG foresees that an interview may not be conducted by the BFA within the first 24 hours of the asylum application.

In Dublin procedures, the rules and practice are the same as in the Regular Procedure: Personal Interview.

The records of the Dublin consultation between Austria and the requested state(s) are made available to the asylum seeker and the legal adviser only after the procedural order of the intention to reject is given and Austria has received the answer from the requested Member State. Sometimes, the requested State has not received all relevant information. One of the judges of the Federal Administrative Court mentioned in a decision regarding a Chechen father whose son was legally residing in Austria that Italy, which had issued a visa for the couple from Chechnya, finally agreed to take charge but was not informed about the severe illness and the disability of the asylum seeker who relied on the care of his son.[61] The Court noted that the dependency clause should have been applied in this case. In another case which involved Bulgaria, Austria did not inform the authorities that the asylum-seeker had been in Serbia for more than 3 months, although there was enough evidence.[62]

 

Appeal
As Dublin cases are rejected as inadmissible, the relevant rules detailed in the section on Admissibility Procedure: Appeal apply.

The time limit within which the appeal against the BFA’s inadmissibility decisions (including Dublin decisions) must be lodged is 2 weeks. The appeal has no suspensive effect, unless the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) grants suspensive effect within 7 calendar days after the appeal reaches the court.[63] The expulsion order may not be executed before the BVwG has decided if the appeal must be given suspensive effect.[64] In Dublin cases, suspensive effect is hardly granted. Sometimes asylum applicants never receive a final decision because they are transferred back to the responsible Member State before the Court’s decision.[65]

The VwGH dealt with the expiry of the transfer period in the context of an appeal that had a suspensive effect. In that case, the decision that gave the complaint a suspensive effect was taken by written procedure and was notified only after the expiry of the six-month transfer period, as laid down in Article 29 (1) of the Dublin III Regulation. The Court considered that granting a suspensive effect after the expiration of the transfer period is not possible and, as a result, the transfer period cannot be extended. Austria was therefore deemed responsible for the asylum application.[66]

The BVwG can either refuse the appeal, confirming the BFA decision, or decide to refer it back to the BFA with the instruction to conduct either an in-merit procedure or investigate the case in more detail (for instance if the Court finds that the BFA has not properly taken into account family ties or that the assessment of the situation in the responsible Member State was based on outdated material or was insufficient with regard to a possible violation of Article 3 ECHR). The documentation of decisions of the Court shows, that the Court decides on the basis of the written appeal and the asylum file without a personal hearing of the asylum seeker.[67]

In 2018, the Austrian legal information system (RIS) provided a list of 1,284 Dublin cases before the BVwG. 975 of these cases are unsuccessful appeals and confirmed the order to return of the persons concerned. In only 54 cases, the Court finds that the transfer period has already expired and that the procedure should therefore be admitted. In 6,8% of the cases the decision of the BFA was referred back by the court. In 2019, 445 Dublin decisions were appealed. In 62 cases (13,9%), the first instance decisions were referred back to the BFA.[68] In 2021, 770 (2020: 394) Dublin decisions were appealed.[69]

In 2022, 549 Dublin decisions were appealed with the assistance of BBU GmbH.[70]

Asylum seekers whose appeals were accepted by the Court have the right to re-enter Austria by showing the decision of the court at the border. If no suspensive effect was granted but the court finds that the decision of the BFA was unlawful, the asylum seeker is also allowed to re-enter.[71] In practice, it only happens in few cases that suspensive effect is granted after transfer/deportation. No cases were reported to asylkoordination in which re-entering the county was denied in such cases.

 

Legal assistance
Free legal assistance during the admissibility procedure was implemented to compensate for the restricted movement of asylum seekers during this type of procedure, as they are obliged to stay within the district of the initial reception centre (EAST). If asylum seekers leave the district of the EAST to consult an attorney-at-law or NGOs – which normally have their offices in bigger cities – they can be subject to a fine ranging from € 100 to € 1,000. In case of repeated violation of the restricted residence (Gebietsbeschränkung), the fine may reach € 5,000 and detention may even be ordered in case the asylum seeker is unable to pay the fine. A violation of the restriction of movement could furthermore be a reason for pre-removal detention. As of September 2023, in 45 cases a punishment of violation of restricted residence was applied by the authorities.[72] The second reason why free legal assistance is provided at this stage of the procedure is the lack of suspensive effect of an appeal in admissibility procedures, which justifies the incorporation of additional safeguards in the first instance procedure.

As discussed in the section on Regular Procedure: Legal Assistance, the quality of the advice provided raises concerns due to a lack of time of legal advisers and a lack of trust of asylum seekers, as the advisers are considered being too closely linked to the BFA. They have their offices within the building of the BFA, they provide assistance for voluntary return and their task is only to provide objective information about the procedure to the asylum seekers; not to assist them in the procedure and defend their interests. The new system of legal counselling established by the state-owned BBU-GmbH in 2021 further strengthens this conflict of interests, as the Federal Agency responsible for providing legal assistance falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, which is also supervising the determining authority (BFA).

In case of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, the appointed legal adviser becomes their legal representative during the admissibility procedure.[73] There is no legal guardian appointed as the Child and Youth Welfare Authority denies its responsibility arguing that during the admissibility procedure it is not clear whether the children have a perspective to stay in Austria. UAM are not able to act without the consent of their legal adviser, for example to choose a legal representative by themselves or to submit an appeal in case the legal adviser fails to do so. After the admissibility procedure is concluded UAM are supposed to be transferred to the provinces where the authorities of Kinder- und Jugendhilfe take over legal guardianship (see Legal representation of unaccompanied minors).

Although Article 29(4) AsylG provides that free legal assistance shall be provided to all asylum seekers at least 24 hours before the hearing on the results of the evidentiary findings determining the responsible Member State under the Dublin Regulation, legal advisers receive the file only shortly before the interview, therefore lacking time to study the file and prepare for the hearing. Moreover, the reform of the new legal aid system through the BBU-G introduces a new threshold which grants the asylum applicant the right to free legal assistance by the Agency only if an appointment – during which the applicant exercises their right to be heard – is scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) after having been notified by the BFA of the intention to reject the asylum application. This means that, if the BFA grants the asylum applicant the right to be heard at a later stage (e.g. in 4 or 5 days), free legal assistance by the Agency will only be available if resources so allow. The discretion of the BFA as regards the timing of the appointment thus has an influence on whether legal assistance will be provided at first instance because the Federal Agency is legally obliged to do so, or whether it will be provided if the Agency’s available resources allow so. In addition, the provision specifies that, if the asylum seeker did not make use of the right to be heard, this does not affect the outcome of the decision on their application for international protection.[74] NGOs are thus extremely concerned about the arbitrary nature of the provision of legal assistance in such cases. The BBU GmbH reports that if an interview is conducted within 72 hours, they are notified to provide legal counselling. The agency however does not have an overview or information, to what share of Dublin procedures they are involved. The Ministry of Interior also does not provide statistics on the matter. Anecdotal evidence shows that only a small part of the Dublin interviews are conducted within 72 hours and consequently only few applicants confronted with a Dublin procedure have access to free legal counselling.

The legal adviser must be present at the interview held to give the asylum seeker an opportunity to be heard. At the interview in relation to Dublin with the BFA, the asylum seeker together with the legal adviser may submit written statements with regard to the situation in the Member State deemed responsible or make requests for additional investigations, but they are not allowed to ask questions; this is usually respected by the legal advisers.

 

Suspension of transfers

Under the Dublin III Regulation, all EU Member States are considered safe places where the asylum applicant may find protection from persecution. An exception applies to cases in which there is an obvious risk of lack of protection, e.g. if it is well-known to the authorities, or if the asylum applicant brings evidence that there is a risk that they will not be protected properly. This real risk cannot be based on mere speculations, but has to be based on individual facts and evidence. This statement of risk has to be related to the individual situation of the asylum applicant.[75]

Country reports from various sources such as AIDA, UNHCR, the US Department of State, Amnesty International, Eurostat, as well as information from ACCORD and Austrian liaison officers are taken into consideration.

According to the jurisprudence, notorious severe human rights violations in regard of Article 3 ECHR have to be taken into consideration ex officio.[76] If the asylum application is already rejected by the Member State responsible for the examination of the application, a divergent interpretation of the Refugee Convention in a Member State or manifestly unlawful procedures could be relevant in an individual case. Generally low recognition rates in a certain Member State are not regarded as a characteristic of a dysfunctional asylum system.[77]

In 2023, 1,240 outgoing Dublin transfers were completed. The main recipient countries were Germany, Croatia and Romania.

Current practice with regard to selected Dublin countries is illustrated below:

Greece: After the ruling of the ECtHR in M.S.S. v Belgium and Greece in 2011, Austria suspended transfers to Greece. The director of the BFA announced Dublin procedures with Greece would start again in March 2017,[78] in line with the European Commission’s recommendation of December 2016, however they did not resume in practice, including in 2023.There were no take back requests sent to Greece until September 2023.[79] The Austrian authorities sometimes immediately make use of the discretionary clause, but this is not general practice[80] despite the lack of transfers in over 10 years.  There are no Dublin transfers to Greece due to legal reasons.[81] In cases of persons that already have received a protection status in Greece before applying in Austria the situation is different (see Suspension  of returns for beneficiaries of protection in another Member State).

Hungary: In 2019 and 2020, one transfer was reportedly carried out respectively in individual cases. While it is clear that individual guarantees must have been secured for the purpose of this transfer, no further information is available on this case. Until September 2023 2023, 21 (2022: 34) take charge and 2 (2022: 11) take back requests were sent to Hungary. No transfers were completed.[82]

Italy: Until September 2023, 414 take charge and 258 take back requests were sent to Italy. In a letter from December 2022, Italy announced that due to technical reasons no Dublin returnees would be taken back from other countries  At the time of writing, this has not changed and no Dublin returns were completed throughout 2023. Decisions are still being made by the authorities but cannot be implemented.

In the past, the Italian Ministry of Interior had been issuing a number of letters guaranteeing that all families with minors transferred to Italy under the Dublin III Regulation would remain together and be accommodated in a facility adapted to their needs. Previous case law has also allowed for the transfer of families to Italy, including of a single mother and her baby;[83] and of a family with four children (out of which two were minors) and their grandparents.[84] The Constitutional Court also found that the situation of asylum seekers in Italy has improved and that special safeguards are no longer necessary.[85] There is no recent jurisdiction on Dublin returns to Italy by Austrian Courts: Requests are issued and the applicants are only admitted to the procedure when the 6 months have passed. Detentions are generally not upheld as there is no feasible perspective for returns to be resumed.[86]

Bulgaria: Transfers to Bulgaria are carried out by the BFA and generally upheld by the BVwG.[87] The VwGH in 2017 found that the BFA must make a thorough assessment of the conditions in Bulgaria before transferring families.[88] In March 2023, the Constitutional Court annulled two decisions of the BVwG in which the latter found a decision of the first instance determining a transfer to Bulgaria to be lawful. In one case the decision was found to have been taken in an arbitrary manner because the BVwG did not examine whether the person concerned would have an effective access to the asylum system without having to fear of a chain pushback to Türkiye.[89] As a reaction to the High Court’s judgements all appeals concerning Bulgaria were upheld. This changed with the update of the country information sheet provided to the authorities and courts by the Staatendokumentation. There it was stated that Bulgaria is no longer rejecting applications by arguing that Turkey is a safe third county. Following this, the Court’s decisions upheld most first instance decisions and confirmed the legality of Dublin returns to Bulgaria.[90] As of May 2024, Dublin transfers to Bulgaria are conducted and the appeals against negative decisions are dismissed in general.

In 2023, in a case of a single mother with her minor daughter the decision was annulled because the BVwG did not take into account that the persons concerned were members of a vulnerable group.[91] In 2024, in one case in which the applicant claimed to have suffered violence in Bulgaria because of his homosexuality, the appeal was sustained by the BVwG; the decision was annulled and sent back to the first instance for further investigations.[92]

In 2023, around 50% (2022: 70%) of all Austrian take back requests were sent to Bulgaria (6,688). 5,893 (2022: 6,619) were accepted by Bulgaria, 114 (2022: 34) transfers were effectively completed.[93]

Croatia: Following the CJEU ruling in A.S. / Jafari in 2017, the BVwG rejected previously suspended cases and the persons concerned were returned to Croatia. In some cases the applications were admitted in Austria due to the expiry of the time limit for the transfer. Since 2019, transfers to Croatia have been completed without Austria asking for individual guarantees. In a case of an accompanied child that needed medical treatment, the revision was rejected from the High Administrative Court, and an individual guarantee was not deemed to be necessary. Almost all BVwG decisions confirm the first instance decisions that find Croatia responsible.[94] Until September 2023, 57 take charge requests and 821 take back requests were sent to Croatia. In the same time, 196 (2022: 37) transfers were completed to Croatia.[95] In 2023, NGOs reported about many negative Dublin decisions and transfers to Croatia. In all cases, Croatia became responsible by not responding to the requests. Some persons transferred claimed that they have never been to Croatia before.

The situation of Dublin returnees
Asylum seekers returning to Austria under the Dublin Regulation, and whose claim is pending a final decision, do not face obstacles if their transfer takes place within two years after leaving Austria. In this case, the discontinued asylum procedure will be reopened as soon as they request for it at the BFA or the BVwG. If a final decision has already been taken on the asylum application upon return to Austria, the new asylum application will be processed as a subsequent asylum application. Dublin returnees are confronted with the same issues as other asylum seekers in accessing the basic care system. As provinces are reluctant to take over asylum seekers from the federal reception centres Dublin returnees might end up staying several weeks or even months in bigger first reception facilities. .

So far the BFA has not been requested to provide guarantees to other Member States prior to transfers.

The BFA is the determining authority responsible for examining applications for international protection and competent to take decisions at first instance as well as for residence permits on exceptional humanitarian grounds and certain Aliens’ Police proceedings. It is an administrative body falling under the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior. The BFA has its headquarters in Vienna and one regional directorate in each of the Provinces. Further organisational units of the BFA are the initial reception centres (EAST). Additional field offices of the regional directorates may be established in the Provinces.[1]

As of September 2023, the BFA had 1,014 staff members, compared to 1,031 at the end of 2022. However, all staff of the BFA are not caseworkers, i.e. the personnel of the determining authority responsible for examining and assessing an application for international protection. Out of the 1,014 officials of the BFA, 441 were caseworkers (compared to 420 in 2022). The majority of these caseworkers were permanent staff.[2]

The BFA has developed its own internal guidelines which are used by caseworkers on a daily basis to examine and decide on applications for international protection. However, these are not publicly available and civil society organisations do not have access to them. Nevertheless, country of origin information (COI) reports that are produced by the BFA are published on its website.[3]

As regards quality assurance and control, the BFA has established both quality assurance and quality control mechanisms, with quality assessors (Qualitätssicherer) specifically dedicated to that end. The quality assessors of the BFA are responsible for double-checking decisions, providing support and guidance to caseworkers and contributing to their development.[4] They are present in all offices of the BFA and meet every three months in the form of a networking event. However, the results of quality assurance and control is not published nor accessible to external entities. The results are only shared with management staff and quality assessors, who subsequently discuss the results with caseworkers.

It should be noted that there is an ongoing cooperation with UNHCR to develop specific assessment methods for the evaluation of asylum procedures. UNHCR selects the focus point for the assessment of the decisions and provides samples of interviews and decisions to train quality assessors of the BFA accordingly.[5] UNHCR can further be consulted in specific procedures, such as the airport procedure.

### Short overview of the asylum procedure
----
SHORT OVERVIEW OF THE ASYLUM PROCEDURE Austria:

Asylum and aliens law procedures are administrative procedures. For these procedures, the General Administrative Procedures Act (AVG) and the BFA Procedures Act (BFA-VG) apply. The Asylum Act (AsylG) and the Aliens Police Act (FPG) however, contain a number of special procedural rules which regulate asylum and aliens law proceedings.

The procedure before the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVwG) is regulated by the Asylum Act, the BFA Procedures Act (BFA-VG), by the General Administrative Procedures Act and the Federal Administrative Court Act (VwGVG) (see Overview of the Legal Framework).

The Asylum Act contains norms on the granting of international protection, expulsion procedures in connection with the rejection or dismissal of applications, provisions on the rejection of applications due to the existence of a “safe third country” or to the responsibility of another state according to the Dublin Regulation, norms on family reunification procedures and on airport procedures. In 2016, “special provisions to maintain public order during border checks” were added to the Asylum Act. It allows the Ministry of Interior to issue a decree that would enable the authorities not to examine asylum applications on the merits. This raised a big public debate about the potential introduction of a ‘quota’ of asylum claims per year, which would trigger the issuance of a decree once it is reached. However, no consensus was found on the matter and the decree was thus never issued. Moreover, the law does not foresee a limit of asylum applications that would trigger such a decree.

First instance procedure: The Asylum Act provides for a single procedure for applications for international protection. If such an application is lodged, the authorities have to decide whether the application is to be rejected on account of safety in a third country or the responsibility of another state. In the first stage of the procedure – called admissibility procedure – the authorities have to decide on the admissibility of the application. If the application is declared admissible, the authorities decide whether the person is to be granted refugee status. In case of rejection of the asylum claim on the merits, the authorities have to assess the need of subsidiary protection. National law does not foresee a separate application for subsidiary protection. In case of rejection of the subsidiary protection claim the authorities have to assess whether a return decision is admissible. All three examinations are done in one procedure. There is also an accelerated procedure for certain claims.

Appeal: Appeals to the Federal Administrative Court are possible against a decision rejecting the asylum application as inadmissible and also against a decision dismissing the application on the merits. The BFA Procedures Act (BGA-VG) regulates the appeal and its effects. Appeals against the decision rejecting the asylum application on the merits have to be submitted within four weeks and have suspensive effect, unless the BFA does not allow for the appeal to have suspensive effect. In the past, there were several legislative attempts to shorten the appeal period of four weeks to two weeks in all cases. The last legislative attempt was annulled by a ruling of the Constitutional Court in 2017.[1] Following the reform, in cases in which the appeal is rejected on formal or inadmissibility reasons and the decision is connected with a measure terminating residence, or when a return decision has already been issued, the appeal lasts only two weeks and does not have suspensive effect. Suspensive effect may be granted by the Court to an appeal against an expulsion order issued together with a decision rejecting the asylum application as inadmissible.[2]

Moreover, Article 18(1) BFA-VG provides a number of grounds for depriving suspensive effect. These include, inter alia, the applicant’s attempt to deceive the BFA concerning they true identity or nationality or the authenticity of their documents, the lack of reasons for persecution, if the allegations made by the asylum seeker concerning the danger they face are manifestly unfounded or if an enforceable deportation order and an enforceable entry ban was issued against the asylum seeker prior to the lodging of the application for international protection.

However, the Court may grant suspensive effect if there would otherwise be a risk of violation of the non-refoulement principle. The Court has to grant suspensive effect if an appeal is lodged against an expulsion order issued together with a decision rejecting the asylum application as inadmissible, if it can be assumed that the decision to refuse entry to the alien at the border and forcible return or deportation to the country to which the expulsion order applies would constitute a real risk of violation of the principle of non-refoulement according to Austria’s international obligations, or would represent a serious threat to their life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal conflict. The reasons must be set out in the appeal decision.

Together with the decision to reject the application for international protection, an expulsion order must be issued, unless reasons related to the right to family and private life according to Article 8 ECHR prevail over public interest and order, or where residence is permitted for other humanitarian reasons.

The evidential requirements are the same for refugee and subsidiary protection status. In appeal procedures before the Court, new facts and evidence may only be submitted in the following cases: if the grounds on which the first instance negative decision was based have undergone any material change; if the first instance procedure was irregular (e.g. if the right to be heard about the findings of the BFA was not respected, or if outdated country of origin information was used or evidence is missing to substantiate the reasoning of the BFA); if such new facts and evidence were not accessible earlier or if the asylum seeker had been unable to submit such new facts and evidence.[3] Decisions of the Court are issued in the form of judgments and all other decisions, such as those allowing the appeal to have suspensive effect, the rejection of an appeal because it was lodged too late, or on the continuation of an asylum procedures that was discontinued (i.e. decisions on procedural issues), are issued in the form of resolutions.

Onward appeal: The BVwG may decide that the rejection of the application can be revised before the Administrative High Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof, VwGH). This possibility is foreseen if a decision on the case depends on a leading decision, e.g. if the Administrative Court’s decision is not based on a previous decision of the Administrative High Court. If the BVwG declares the ordinary revision inadmissible, the asylum seeker may bring in an extraordinary revision.[4] The BFA can also file a revision with the VwGH to challenge decisions issued by the BVwG.

Appeals to the Federal Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof, VfGH) may be lodged in instances where the applicant claims a violation of a right guaranteed by constitutional law.

Return: At every stage of the procedure, asylum seekers are informed about the possibility of support for voluntary return. The BFA can also order a mandatory consultation with regard to return. In these cases, the applicant has to get in contact with the return counselling department of the state owned BBU GmbH. When an asylum seeker leaves the country – no matter if in the context of voluntary repatriation to their country of origin or if the person is not reachable for the authorities – the asylum proceedings are filed as discontinued. Upon return to Austria, an application to reopen the procedure has to be brought in.

Any application for international protection which is deemed inadmissible or rejected on the merits is automatically connected to a decision assessing whether a return to the country of origin is possible or if the right to private and family life of the applicant prevail. [5] The return decision is issued together with the negative decision concerning the asylum application by the BFA in first instance. Similarly, a return decision is also issued in the case of a withdrawal of international protection.

[4] The BVwG can decide to declare the ordinary revision as admissible – which means that it considers that there is a fundamental legal question at stake – or as inadmissible – which means that the applicant and their lawyer must demonstrate themselves that there is fundamental legal question at stake so as to initiate an extraordinary revision. The main difference is that, in the case of an ordinary/regular revision, the applicant does not have to explain what fundamental legal question is at stake and that, in cases where the regular revision is declared as admissible, it is more probable that government sponsored legal aid will be granted (which is not a task of the BBU but of the bar association in case of appeals in front of the High Court).

B. Access to the procedure and registration
1: Access to the territory and push backs
----
ACCESS TO THE TERRITORY AND PUSH BACKS in Austria:
In July 2021, the Regional Administrative Court of Styria issued a landmark decision concerning a case of a Moroccan national living in Bosnia. Despite having asked for asylum in September 2020 after crossing the green border from Slovenia to Austria along with a group of other asylum seekers, he was handed over to the Slovenian police based on a readmission agreement who also ignored his claim. He was subsequently returned to Croatia and pushed-back to Bosnia.[1] The Court concluded that the policemen “overheard” the asylum application, i.e. they did not carry out a proper interview; the body search resulted in inhuman treatment and the rejection to Slovenia was unlawful. In the statement of facts, the Court stated that pushbacks are “partly applied as a method in Austria.”[2] The Ministry of Interior denied the fact that an application for international protection had been made and brought in a legal remedy to the High Administrative Court.

In 2020, 514 persons from 48 different countries were handed over to Slovenian authorities based on this ad hoc agreement.[3] This agreement originally focused on the uncomplicated return of Slovenian citizens to Slovenia when crossing the border. No formal procedure is known: when a person identified to be returned on the basis of the agreement the police forces of the two countries interact and organise the transfer. There is no legal remedy foreseen in the process. Persons that have applied for asylum cannot be returned on the basis of this agreement.

In July 2021, a Somali minor was also unlawfully returned to Slovenia on the basis of that readmission agreement, despite the fact that he had articulated the words “asylum” various times when talking to police officers. In February 2022, the Regional Administrative Court of Styria decided that the police measures taken were unlawful and resulted in an illegal push back.[4] In Slovenia, the asylum request was meanwhile accepted, and an asylum status had already been granted.[5]

In both cases, the revision requested by the Regional Police Directorate Styria to the High Administrative Court were rejected in May 2022.[6] As a consequence, the Ministry of Interior by non-public internal Decree GZ: 2022-0.344.927, “Awareness with regard to rejections”, 11 May 2022, regulated on how to proceed with foreigners that apply for asylum when apprehended by the police. The decree explicitly states that, just because the person does not mention the word “asylum”, that does not mean they are not applying for international protection, as the application can be brought in by “conclusive action”. The police officer should thus also come to the conclusion that the person is applying for international protection through their behaviour, actions, etc and the police officer should in such case take appropriate action. A mandatory e-learning tool was developed and is available for all officers that are on duty close to border regions.

As a response to the allegations of illegal push backs and unlawful returns taking place at the Southern border to Slovenia and the fact that the number of persons affected by readmissions to Slovenia almost doubled from 81 to 174 in 2020,[7] the initiative “Push back alarm” was founded by activists. Similar to “Alarm phone”, the initiative offers a phone number where persons that crossed the border can request a follow up with the police and ask whether their asylum application is being accepted.[8] In 2023, the number of persons returned to Slovenia based on the bilateral readmission agreement was 62 (compared to 58 in 2022). Nationalities of the persons returned are not indicated.[9] According to the AIDA report on Slovenia, persons who have been summarily returned back from Austria to Slovenia in 2020 were mostly expelled to Croatia by the Slovenian authorities. After the second judgement concerning pushbacks by Regional Administrative Court of Styria, according to the NGO Push Back Alarm Austria there were no more reports of pushbacks on Austrian territory throughout 2022 and 2023.

Since December 2022, the Austrian police entered a joint police cooperation with Hungarian police called “Operation Fox.” The goal of the joint operation which first lasted until May and then was prolonged until mid-2024 is “combatting illegal migration” and transnational criminal activities such as human smuggling. As of February 2023, there were 29 Austrian police officers deployed to this unit that also operates on Hungarian soil. As there were reports of pushbacks conducted by the Hungarian police especially on the Serbo-Hungarian border, the police operation is controversial. The Ministry of Interior states that on the basis of the Prüm Decision,[10] Austrian officers can apply coercive power on Hungarian territory.[11]

Refusals of entry
Following the German announcement of the prolongation of border controls in October 2019, the Austrian Minister of Interior also prolonged the temporary border controls with Slovenia and Hungary until 14 May 2020.[12] The argumentation of the Austrian Government had slightly changed, however: while it initially argued that the situation was not sufficiently stable, the Minister of Interior argued that “border controls in the heart of Europe have led to a positive effect on migration movements”.[13] These border controls were further prolonged on 11 May 2021, based on the “continuing migration pressure” and “the tense situation resulting from Covid-19”.[14] Border controls with Hungary and Slovenia are currently prolonged until November 2024.[15] Furthermore, since September 2023 border controls to Slovakia and Czech Republic have been regularly prolonged every two months, currently until June 2024.[16] The prolongation of border controls were justified, among others, by the fear of proliferation of weapons from Ukraine[17] and the fight against terrorism.[18] More information on the German-Austrian border controls can be found in the AIDA report on Germany.[19]

Slovenia has reaffirmed its opposition as regards Austrian border controls in recent years. The Slovenian Ministry of the Interior considers border controls unjustified and disproportionate and has stressed that there were no statistics demonstrating a risk of secondary migration nor a threat to Austria’s internal security. In 2019 it added that the border controls are “unnecessary and cause great economic damage”.[20] In 2023, the President of Slovenia complained that Austria has no reason to continue border controls with the country. Slovenia itself however also prolonged its own border controls with Croatia until June 2024.[21] As of 21 December 2023, 384 persons coming from Slovenia were denied entry.[22]

Germany refused entry to 11,461 persons in 2023 (2022: 13,076) at the Austrian border.[23] At the same time, 1,319 persons were transferred from Germany to Austria via bilateral return agreement (2022: 631). Following the ECJ judgement C-143/22 regarding refusals of entry at internal borders where controls have been reintroduced, Austrian officials discussed the situation at the borders with German officials: Germany assured that asylum seekers reaching Germany will not be denied entry or be rejected at the border.[24]

Hungary and Austria engage in a bilateral police cooperation on Hungarian territory in the so-called “Operation Fox”. Since September 2021, Austria deploys police officers to the Hungarian-Serbian and Hungarian-Serbian-Romanian border. At the end of 2023, 40 Austrian police officers supported the Hungarian police. In 2024, this number should increase to 60 police officers.[25] The Ministry of Interior stated that the Austrian police is directly using force, but rather just supporting the Hungarian police in their tasks. The operation costed more than 2 million euros in 2023.[26] Operation Fox was extended until May 2024 and is likely to be prolonged. 180 alleged smugglers were apprehended. In May 2023 the fact that Hungary released hundreds of convicted smugglers due to high costs and lack of detention space caused an uproar in Austria. The Hungarian ambassador was called for a consultation by the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[27] Until 2023, 194 persons were denied entry by Austria at the Hungarian border.[28] In September, an alleged pushback was reported to the NGOs asylkoordination österreich and Push-back Alarm Austria. It was observed that Austrian police officers controlled an Afghan national on a train from Budapest to Vienna. The police officers apprehended the person and took him off the train. The brother of the Afghan national residing in Austria told that his apprehended brother wanted to ask for asylum but was pushed back to Serbia without any procedure or decision. These allegations however could not be proven. The person involved decided to not take the case to court.[29]

As there are no border controls from Austria at the borders with Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Liechtenstein, no rejections were made in 2022 at these borders. In 2023, 384 persons coming from Slovenia were denied entry, 1 from Czech Republic, 194 from Hungary and 22 from Slovakia. In the same time 666 persons were denied entry to Austria at the airports.[30]

 

Special provisions to maintain public order during border checks
With a legal amendment, which entered into force on 1 June 2016, “special provisions to maintain public order during border checks” were added to the Asylum Act.[31]

The provision (discussed publicly as “emergency provision”), which can be activated through a decree of the federal government, foresees that asylum seekers have no longer access to the asylum procedure in Austria when a maximum number, i.e. a ‘quota’, of asylum applications to be examined on the merits, is reached. For 2016 this number was set at 37,500 applications and was not reached.[32] For 2017 the limit was set at 35,000 applications and was not reached either. The limit for 2018 was set at 30,000 applications and was not exceeded. For the year 2019, the maximum was set at 25,000 asylum applications. However, the decree of the federal government was never activated. There are no known plans to activate it in the near future and no further projections of quotas for the upcoming years. Even though more than 112,000 applications were registered in Austria in 2022, no public discussion concerning triggering the ‘emergency provision’ arose. As the number of asylum applications decreased to almost 60,000 in 2023 and the backlog of pending cases decreased by almost 15,000, reaching to 39,000 cases at the end of 2023, it was not possible to argue for the existence of the preconditions for triggering the emergency provisions, such as an existing threat to public security.[33]

The possibility of rejection at the border relies on the distinction between “making” and “lodging” an asylum application as per Article 6 of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive. After an application is made before a police officer at the border, or in a registration centre (Registrierstelle) if the person is found to be irregularly on the territory, the Aliens Police will be able to reject the person at the border or to issue a return decision before the initial interview (Erstbefragung).[34]

Refusal to register an application is not possible where return would be incompatible with the principle of non-refoulement under Articles 2 and 3 ECHR, or with Article 8 ECHR.[35]

An asylum seeker is not issued a decision ordering return and cannot appeal against the refusal to have their claim examined. In such a case, the asylum seeker has no right to remain on the territory.[36] Therefore, an appeal to the State Administrative Court (LVwG) does not have suspensive effect.[37]

Although it has not been activated yet, the amendment has been criticised by UNHCR and civil society organisations,[38] as it enables police authorities rather than the BFA to deny a person access to the asylum procedure, without procedural guarantees or legal assistance, while an appeal can only be made after the expulsion has been carried out. The activation of the emergency provision also suspends the application of the Dublin Regulation.

 

Border monitoring
There is no border monitoring mechanism in Austria.

 

Legal access to the territory
From 2013 to 2017, a successful resettlement programme “Humanitarian Admission Programme” was implemented bringing around 1,700 persons to Austria. After the last persons were transferred to Austria, the resettlement programme was terminated and no other programme has been launched since. Austria then announced in 2017 that it would relocate some applicants to Austria, especially young applicants and juveniles. In reality, Austria never received any applicant through the relocation scheme. Furthermore, a humanitarian visa can only be granted if the authority is convinced that the applicant demonstrates a willingness to return to the home country.

Austria did not participate in refugee evacuation programmes from Afghanistan after the takeover of the Taliban regime in August 2021. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported Austrian nationals and persons with Austrian residency status to get out of Afghanistan (mainly to Pakistan). In one publicly known case, the Austrian embassy in Islamabad confirmed to an Afghan national that it would issue a visa for Austria, but the embassy then refused to issue it when the latter arrived in Pakistan. The woman was instead issued a visa by Germany .[39]

Following the earthquake in Syria and Türkiye in February 2023, Austria announced that it will not make any visa liberalisation but will prioritise the handling applications for short term visas with a maximum duration of 6 months by persons affected by the earthquake that have relatives in Austria.[40]

In 2023, 16% of all applicants (9,180)[41] arrived in Austria via family reunification procedure. This is a slight increase compared to 2022 (8,294).

2: Registration of the asylum application
----
REGISTRATION OF THE ASYLUM APPLICATION in Austria:
An application for international protection can be made before an agent of the public security service or a security authority on Austrian territory.[1] The asylum application is registered as soon as asylum is requested. There has been no possibility to apply for asylum at Austrian embassies or consulates abroad since 2001. A first interview has to be conducted by the public security service.[2] All documents have to be sent to the BFA to obtain guidelines on the next steps to be taken. This includes sharing the minutes of the first interrogation as well as a report showing the time, place and circumstances of the application, information on identity and the travel route, in particular the place where the border was crossed, as well as the result of the identity screening.

In August 2022, the police changed the registration system by internal decree. Unaccompanied minors (UAM) continued to be handled in the regular scheme, while all other applicants were only registered and fingerprinted immediately at the border. In case of a EURODAC hit the applicants were also transferred to the first reception centres. All others were sent to other provinces to have their first interviews conducted by other Regional Police Directorates. This led to several problems as the police stations were not able to provide places to sleep.[3]

In 2023, the police reverted back to the old registrations system directly at the border as the numbers of applications decreased sharply at the end of the year. The extraordinary measure was not necessary anymore as the registration capacity of the Regional Police Directorate in Burgenland (region close to the border) could cope with the number of arrivals. In January 2022, 2.261 persons were apprehended in the province of Burgenland. In January 2023, the number of apprehended persons decreased to 100.[4]

Applications for international protection are to be forwarded to the BFA without delay.

Based on the information submitted by the police, the BFA orders the transfer of the applicant to an EAST or regional directorate of the BFA. The BFA can also order the applicant to go to the EAST or regional directorate on their own, and transfer costs will be covered.[5] Through this instruction on the next steps to be followed, the application is officially lodged.[6]

Persons legally staying in Austria (i.e. through a residence permit) must submit their asylum application at the public security service too. The BFA orders applicants to appear before the branch office within 14 calendar days.[7] Otherwise, the application will be terminated as being no longer relevant.

Asylum seekers parents of children born in Austria are obliged to inform the BFA within two weeks of the birth of the child. Upon receipt of this information, the application is automatically registered and lodged for the child.[8]

In 2023, a total of 58,686 applications for international protection were lodged in Austria. This marks a 48% decrease compared to 2022, where 112,000 applications were lodged. Despite this, the number of asylum applications in 2023 was the fourth highest since the ratification of the Geneva Refugee Convention. In 2021, after three years of very low numbers in the context of the pandemic, the numbers of applications almost reached 2016 levels (42,285). The even higher increase in 2022 was however accompanied by a record number of discontinued cases (42,549), most likely due to onward movement of the applicants to other countries. This trend continued in 2023, as almost 30,000 discontinued cases were registered.

Each member of a family has to submit a separate application for international protection. During the interview, they are asked whether they have individual reasons to apply for protection or whether they want to rely on the reasons of one of their family members. Accompanied children are represented in the procedure by their parents, who are requested to submit the reasons on behalf of their children.

C. Procedures
# Regular procedure
----
REGULAR PROCEDURE Austria (C):

General (scope, time limits)

The regular asylum procedure is regulated in the AsylG (predominantly material law) and AVG and BFA-VG (predominantly procedural law).

As already mentioned, the BFA is a specific department of the Ministry of interior, dealing with asylum matters. In 2014, the tasks of the BAF were further extended to cover some immigration law procedures.

According to the General Administrative Procedures Act (AVG), decisions have to be taken within 6 months after the application for international protection has been lodged.[1] Within 20 calendar days, the BFA has to decide whether it intends to reject the application as inadmissible due to the responsibility of another Member State under the Dublin Regulation, the application of the safe third country concept or in case of subsequent asylum applications, or to dismiss the application for other reasons.[2] Since 2018, the admissibility procedure may be prolonged by lifting the 20 days deadline in manifestly unfounded cases.[3] However, if no information about the intention to reject the application is issued within 20 calendar days, the application is automatically admitted into the regular procedure. Thus, the asylum-seeker should receive the preliminary residence permit as asylum seeker and be allocated to the reception system of a federal province.[4] On the contrary, if the asylum application is deemed inadmissible the asylum-seeker receives legal assistance and has to be heard in presence of they lawyer. There is no legal remedy against this procedural order.

If no procedural order is notified to the asylum seeker within 20 days, the asylum application is admitted to the regular procedure – except in Dublin cases if requests to other Member States to take charge or take back the asylum seeker are made within this time frame.

In case of delay from the BFA, the asylum seeker may request that the case be referred to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision (Säumnisbeschwerde).[5] However, in practice asylum seekers do not frequently make such requests, as they miss a chance of receiving a positive decision at first instance (by the BFA). In 2023, several asylum seekers and counselling organisations reported that one lawyer based in Vienna filed Säumnisbeschwerde in around 1,000 asylum cases. In case of delay from the Federal Administrative Court, a request for the establishment of a deadline may be addressed to the Administrative High Court.

In 2023 the average duration of the asylum procedure at first instance amounted to 5.5 months,[6] compared to 3.5 months in 2022 and 3.2 months in 2021.[7] The sharp drop after 2017 (average duration of 14 months) is a result of the broader application of fast track procedures. In 2020, 807 applications were fast tracked,[8] out of which 405 were rejected within 72 hours by the BFA. In 27 cases the decision was appealed but the rejection was then upheld by the BVwG.[9] The average length of the fast-track procedure was 22.7 days in 2020.

In 2023, the number of decisions taken in the fast-track procedure decreased compared to the record number of 2022. 8,121 decisions were taken in the fast-track procedures (compared to 22,109 in 2022 and 2,581 in 2021). The average length of the fast-track procedure in the first half of 2023 was 34.5 days (2022: 24.7 days).[10] The accelerated procedure led to 300 decisions in 2023, and in 88.5% of the cases the decision was issued within 72 hours (2022: 67%).

The decisions in both fast-track and accelerated procedures mainly concerned applicants from countries listed as safe countries of origin and manifestly ill-founded applications from applicants from India. In the accelerated procedure, 59% of the decisions concerned applicants from Morocco, 16% from India and 9% from Pakistan. In fast track procedures, 84% concerned Moroccan applicants, 4% applicants from Pakistan and 3% from Tunisia.[11]

In recent years, the Austrian Ombudsman has received numerous complaints on the length of asylum procedures at first instance. It received 1,500 complaints in 2016; 2,000 complaints in 2017 and 320 complaints in 2018. Out of the 320 complaints received in 2018, a violation of the duty to take a decision within the set limit was confirmed in 248 cases. Moreover, in 2018, 220 complaints were filed concerning length of procedures at second instance, and in 176 cases a violation was identified.[12] In 2020, the Austrian Ombudsman concluded in 197 cases that the BVwG violated its obligation to make a decision and did not take any steps in the asylum complaint procedure, reiterating that organisational deficiencies and increasing asylum applications are not a legally relevant justification. The Ombudsman suggested that the procedure should be concluded quickly in the cases brought forward. Numerous complaints were filed concerning deficiencies in the first instance proceedings.[13] In 2021, the Austrian Ombudsman Board received 14 complaints concerning the length of first-instance asylum procedures and 151 complaints mainly about the length of second-instance asylum procedures from 1 January to 17 September 2021.[14] After a decrease in the number of complaints over several years, there was a significant increase in the summer of 2022. 418 persons lodged a complaint concerning the length of the procedure, of which 284 were decided by the Ombudsperson. In 195 cases, the complaints were justified; in 95 cases the BFA decided after the complaint was lodged.[15] In 2023, 771 persons lodged a complaint concerning the BFA, and 489 complaints were deemed justified. 527 complaints concerned applicants from 2022, mostly from Syria (455). 69 cases concerned the family reunification process, of which 25 complaints concerning the length of procedures were justified. In one case the embassy had sent the file to the BFA in October 2022 and the BFA had not undertaken any procedural step in a whole year.[16]

At the end of 2023, 38,921 (2022: 53,107) cases were pending, out of which 30,258 (2022: 46,811) at first instance and 8,663 (2022: 6,296) at second instance.[17] The second instance backlog slightly increased after decreasing for several years. The number of pending cases at first instance decreased by 34% (from 46,000 to 30,000) compared to 2022.[18] Given that the number of recipients of Basic Care increased only by 4,500 over the year (January 17,000 in January to 21,500 in December) and the high number of discontinued cases (42,000), it is to be expected that the number of applicants actually still residing in Austria is much lower than the number of pending cases. The BFA files a case as discontinued three months after not being able to reach the applicant.

Prioritised examination and fast-track processing
The time limit for decisions for the BFA and the Federal Administrative Court are reduced to 3 months in case the asylum seeker is detained pending deportation.[19] The same maximum time limit applies to the “procedure for the initiation of a measure terminating residence” (see Accelerated Procedure).

In 2023, the practice of fast-track processing focused on applicants coming from countries listed as “safe countries of origin” and on manifestly ill-founded applications. In second instance, there is also a focus on applicants who have already been sentenced by a criminal court. The great majority of fast-track processing deals with cases from applicants originating from so called safe countries of origin (see Safe Country of Origin). This was also due to the high number of applications from Morocco at the start of 2023.

 

Personal interview
All asylum seekers must undergo a personal interview, provided that they have legal capacity to do so. At the start of each interview, asylum seekers are asked whether they feel physically and psychologically fit for the interview. If not, the interview will be postponed. In practice, a postponement is not requested by the applicants.

Asylum seekers are further subject to an interrogation by security services shortly after lodging the application for the purposes of the Dublin and Admissibility Procedure.[22] These interrogations are carried out with a view to establish the identity and the travel route of the asylum seeker. They should not, however, refer to the merits of the application such as specific reasons for fleeing and lodging an asylum application. Despite the fact that the first interrogation is conducted by the police and not by caseworkers of the BFA,[23] the statements made by the asylum seeker at this stage of the admissibility procedure have an important impact on the asylum procedure as they are accorded particular importance by the BFA.[24] The Constitutional Court confirmed in a judgement of 2012 that reasons for applying for international protection shall not be in the focus of the first interview conducted by police services.[25]

Asylum seekers may be accompanied by a person they trust (i.e. person of confidence) and unaccompanied children cannot be interviewed without the presence of their legal representative.[26]

The law further provides for a choice of interviewer according to gender considerations in cases where the asylum seeker’s fear of persecution is related to sexual self-determination.[27] The authorities must demonstrate that they have informed the asylum applicant of the possibility to be interviewed by an official of the same sex.[28] In practice, however, this is not consistently applied with regard to interpreters.[29] In the appeal procedure, infringements of the right to sexual self-determination have to be expressed in the written appeal in order to have the hearing at the Court held by a judge of the same sex. The Constitutional Court ruled that UNHCR guidelines have to be applied to male asylum seekers accordingly.[30]

Interpretation
Interpreters are provided by the BFA and cover most of the languages, but interviews may also be conducted in a language the asylum seeker is deemed to understand sufficiently.[31] The provision of interpreters has been reported as not satisfactory with regard to certain languages, even in cases where a significant number of asylum seekers may be concerned (e.g. Chechen refugees are often interviewed in Russian).[32] Asylum seekers are asked at the beginning of the interview if they understand the interpreter. There are no standards for the qualification of interpreters in asylum procedures. Interpretation is often not done by accredited interpreters; usually persons with the requested language knowledge are contracted on a case-by-case basis. UNHCR has published a training manual for interpreters in asylum procedures.[33]

The Federal Law on the Establishment of the Federal Agency for Care and Support Services Limited Liability Company (BBU-G) passed in June 2019 foresees that a federal agency annexed to the Ministry of Interior should be responsible for the provision of interpreters for the purpose of asylum procedures as of 1 January 2021. This includes the provision of interpreters both at first and second instance, but also in case of oral hearings in front of the BVwG as well as in procedures concerning basic support. The law lists a wide range of areas in which interpreters should be provided by the federal agency, inter alia for interviews related to the making of an application for international protection; for measures relating to the termination of the right to stay as well as for the granting or limitation of basic services. As of January 2021, nine interpreters (five full time equivalent) were employed by the BBU GmbH.[34] In practice, the service provided by internal interpreters were not of great relevance but is to be seen as a test phase for a possible expansion of the department in future. The state-run agency took over the existing system established by the NGOs. In most cases, external interpreters were hired throughout 2023.

Videoconferencing, recording and transcript
Article 19(3) AsylG allows for tape recording of the interview, which is, however, rarely used in practice.

Video conferencing was introduced in 2018. The BFA in Burgenland held interviews to assist the BFA in Vienna and in Vorarlberg in this context.[35] This new practice is based on Art. 51a of the General Administrative Act, which allows the use of technical facilities for word and image transmission – unless a personal interview is necessary for economical or personal reasons.

There are concerns about the practice of conducting interviews through video conferencing as there is no standard procedure to handle these new tools and they raise issues of confidentiality and procedural rights. Lawyers reported an increase in videoconferencing by the BFA and BVwGH during 2020. In most cases, it is up to the applicant and the legal representative to arrange the necessary technical equipment. Issues reported in certain cases include: a judge turning off the video during a court session; the impossibility to see the translator on video; the fact that in certain cases the judges did not allow the legal representative to sit in the room as the applicant; or the fact that in certain cases a protocol was sent without encryption. The Ministry of Interior reported if there are statistics as to in how many interviews videoconferencing tools were applied in 2022 and 2023.[36]

It should be noted that, as part of its BRIDGE project, UNHCR Austria has produced a checklist “Self-check for interviews and negotiations using technical equipment for word and image transmission in the asylum procedure” for videoconferences in asylum procedures.[37]

The transcript is more or less verbatim. Its content may depend on the caseworkers’ and interpreter’s summarising the answers, choosing expressions that fit the transcript or translating each sentence of the asylum seeker.[38] Immediately after the interview, the transcript is translated by the same interpreter in a language the asylum seeker understands and the asylum seeker has the possibility to ask for corrections and completion immediately after the interview. By signing the transcript, they agree with its content. If asylum seekers find something incorrect in the transcript after having signed it at the end of the interview, they should send a written statement to the BFA as soon as possible.[39] In practice, asylum seekers do not frequently ask immediately after the interview for correction of the report. Some asylum seekers explain that they were too tired to be able to follow the translation of the transcript.[40] The OHCHR stated in its report on the mission to Austria from October 2018 that many caseworkers of the BFA are not adequately trained in using techniques that fit the needs of asylum applicants. In a number of cases monitored by the OHCHR, negative decisions of the BFA were based on personal views and involved biased questioning during interviews as well as stereotypes on gender and race.[41]

Appeal
Appeal before the BVwG
Appeals against a negative first instance decision generally have to be submitted within 4 weeks of the receipt of the decision and the whole asylum file is forwarded by the BFA to the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG).[42] However, following an amendment that came into effect on 1 September 2018, the time limit has been set at 2 weeks for appeals in inadmissibility procedures and in cases of status withdrawals that were initiated along with a return decision.[43]

Within 2 months following the lodging of an appeal, the BFA may decide to modify the decision that is being challenged.[44] This means that it can decide either to annul, reject or change its initial decision. However, where the BFA refrains from modifying its decision, it forwards the appeal to the Court. In practice, there are not many cases known where the BFA decides to modify its own decision.

In case refugee status or subsidiary protection status is not granted by the BFA, the asylum applicant will be assigned a free legal adviser provided by the state at the time of notification of the first instance decision. Since January 2021, legal assistance is provided by a new federal agency, however (see Legal Assistance).

Article 18(1) BFA-VG provides that the suspensive effect of the appeal may be withdrawn by the BFA where the application is manifestly unfounded, i.e. where:

The applicant comes from a safe country of origin;
Has already been resident in Austria for at least 3 months prior to the lodging of the application;
The applicant has attempted to deceive the BFA concerning their true identity or nationality or the authenticity of their documents;
The asylum seeker has not adduced any reasons for persecution;
The allegations made by the asylum seeker concerning the danger they face clearly do not correspond with reality;
An enforceable deportation order or an enforceable entry ban was issued against the asylum seeker prior to the lodging of the application for international protection; or
The asylum seeker refuses to give fingerprints.
The BFA uses this possibility to withdraw the suspensive effect especially when there is an enforceable deportation order or when there are no reasons for persecution stated, NGO counselling organisations told asylkoordination.

Moreover, the BFA must withdraw the suspensive effect of an appeal where:[45]

The immediate departure of the third-country national is required for reasons of public policy or public security;
The third-country national has violated an entry ban and has returned to Austrian territory; or
There is a risk of absconding.
The BVwG must grant automatic suspensive effect within 1 week from the lodging of the appeal, where it assumes that return would expose the concerned person to a real risk of a violation of Articles 2, 3, 8 and 13 ECHR or Protocols 6; or to a serious threat to life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of conflict in line with Article 15(c) of the recast Qualification Directive.[46] The reasons must be set out in the main complaint. In cases where there is an enforceable deportation order and no reason for persecution stated, the BVwG does not grant suspensive effect.[47]

Appeals against the rejection of an application with suspensive effect have to be ruled by the Court within 8 weeks.[48] The asylum appeal has suspensive effect as long as the case is pending in court.

The BVwG is organised in chambers, each of which is responsible for certain groups of countries. In recent years, the Court processed appeals on asylum cases as follows:

Following the increase of appeals and backlog of cases at second instance, judges from different fields of law have gradually been assigned to decide upon asylum procedures since 2017; despite their lack of expertise on asylum-related matters. In 2022, the BVwG concluded 13,300 procedures in which 20,500 decisions were taken. 9,700 decisions of the BFA were cancelled/annulled or amended by the BVwG, while 7,900 decisions of the BFA were confirmed.[49] 6,500 court hearings were conducted in 2022 and 4,550 in the first half of 2023. In the first half of 2023, in 4,320 first instance cases the appeal was sustained and the decisions were cancelled/annulled or amended. In 5,070 cases the decisions of the first instance were confirmed.[50]

Note: JH refers to the first half of the year (January to June)

By 2023, more than 40% of all decisions challenged were dismissed or amended by the BVwG. This confirms the trend of the last years, with consistently at least one third of decisions being overturned. Moreover, the first instance authority now evaluates whether the reason why a decision was annulled or amended were external or internal. External factors are e.g. a change of situation in the country of origin since the first instance decision took place or if new evidence was brought in. Internal factors are e.g. inaccurate investigations, (legal) interpretation mistakes or formal errors committed by the authority. In 2022, 11,049 challenged decisions (2021: 15,353) were decided upon by the BVwG. 4,662 (2021: 5,852) first instance decisions were confirmed, while 5,364 (2021: 8,146) decisions were annulled or amended. The rest were neutral decisions.

According to the analysis tool BERT, 2,803 decisions were annulled or amended because of internal reasons. This means more than 52% were annulled or amended for internal reasons such as mistakes of the authority.[51]

The BVwG can request another hearing and additional examinations if necessary. Conversely, the BFA-VG also allows for exceptions to a personal hearing on an appeal; i.e. a hearing must not be held if the facts seem to be established from the case file or if it is established that the submission of the applicant does not correspond to the facts.[52] This provision must be read in light of the restrictions on the submission of new facts in the appeal procedure.

It should be further noted that video conferencing tools are available at a small scale at the Courts, but they are rarely used.

The question whether a personal hearing before the BVwG has to take place or not has been brought before the Constitutional Court (VfGH). The Court ruled that not holding a personal hearing in the appeal procedure does not violate Article 47(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Charter rights may be pleaded before the Constitutional Court. The Court stated that Article 41(7) AsylG,[53] is in line with Article 47(2) of the EU Charter if the applicant was heard in the administrative procedure.[54] However, subsequent rulings of the Administrative High Court and the Constitutional Court have conversely specified the obligation of the Administrative Court to conduct a personal hearing. In the case of an Afghan asylum seeker, the Administrative Court had confirmed the first instance decision which found the asylum seeker’s application to be lacking credibility due to discrepancies in statements about his age. The Constitutional Court ruled that, by deciding without a personal hearing, the Administrative Court had violated the right laid down in Article 47(2) of the EU Charter.[55] Two rulings to the same effect were delivered by the Constitutional Court in September 2014.[56]

The Administrative High Court has specified that all relevant facts have to be assessed by the determining authority and have to be up to date at the time of the decision of the court.[57] It further stated that it was not necessary to explicitly request an oral hearing if the facts were not sufficiently clear or if the statements of the applicant in their appeal contradicted the statements taken by the first instance authority.[58]

The possible outcome of an appeal can be the granting of a status, the refusal of a status, or a referral by the BVwG back to the BFA for further investigations and a re-examination of the case. Hearings at the Court are public, but the public may be excluded on certain grounds. Decisions of the BVwG are published on the legal information website of the Federal Chancellery.[59]

As regards the average processing time for the appeal body to make a decision, the Ministry of Justice indicated that 22.4% of appeals challenging decisions of the BFA in asylum procedures were concluded within 6 months in 2020, while 17.4% took longer than 3 years.[60] 409 Dublin cases were decided in 2020, of which 353 were decided within 6 months (86%).[61] Disaggregated data on the average processing time at second instance were shared in 2020 as follows. Data from July 2022 show the processing time of pending cases during the first half of the year:

Onward appeal before the VwGH

Decisions of the BVwG may be appealed before the VwGH. The eligibility to appeal to the VwGH is determined by the BVwG, but in case the Administrative Court declares a regular revision as inadmissible, the asylum seeker may lodge an “extraordinary” revision.[62] For that purpose, the applicant may submit a request for free legal assistance as well as for the suspensive effect of the complaint.

Out of 1,027 (2021: 2,130 2020: 1,633) revisions conducted in 2022, 29 (2021: 18, 2020: 35) were regular revisions and 998 (2021: 2,112,2020: 1,598) were extraordinary revisions. In 2022, out of the 29 regular revisions, 9 were requested by the determining authority and 20 by applicants. Out of the 998 extraordinary revisions, 66 were requested the determining authority and 932 by applicants.[63]. In 2021, 268 revisions were granted and the decision of the BVwG was cancelled. Corresponding data for 2023 is not available.

In case the asylum applicant seeks to challenge the decision in front of the BVwG and if they claim it is violating a constitutional right, they can lodge an appeal within 6 weeks, after the ruling of the Federal Administrative Court has become final. Asylum seekers are informed of the possibility to address a complaint to the Constitutional Court in writing and this information is translated in a language the asylum seeker understands. In that context, it has to be mentioned that the ECHR is part of Austria’s constitutional law. Therefore the risk of violation of Articles 2, 3 or 8 ECHR can be challenged in front of the Constitutional Court, while the rejection of an application for international protection does not fall under the Court’s competence. The appeal does not have automatic suspensive effect, however. Around 97 decisions of the BVwG, in which the decision was considered arbitrary, have been ruled unlawful by the Constitutional Court in 2019.[64] In 2020, 107 decisions were considered arbitrary and ruled unlawful by the Constitutional Court.[65] No data was available for 2021-2023 at the time of writing.

Asylum seekers face difficulties to access constitutional appeals as the payment of a fee of € 240 is required to that end. Furthermore, asylum seekers are not heard in person before the Constitutional Court, which rather requests written statements from the BVwG.

 

Legal assistance
Legal assistance at first instance
In June 2019, the Austrian Parliament adopted a law establishing a Federal Agency for Care and Support Services (Bundesagentur für Betreuungs- und Unterstützungsleistungen, BBU GmbH) which is in charge inter alia of providing legal assistance to asylum seekers at first and second instance since 1 January 2021. The new law has been criticised by several organisations, as it raises concerns over the risk of arbitrary access to free legal assistance. In its Legal note on the Austrian law, ECRE demonstrated that while access to legal assistance at first instance was the general rule under the previous Article 49(1) BFA-VG, it becomes the exception under the new law. With the exception of unaccompanied minors, legal assistance at first instance shall now only be provided according to the “available possibilities”, and does not constitute a right, except in specific cases listed in the Asylum Act. In other words, access to free legal assistance at first instance is only granted when existing resources are available (e.g. staff and funding), and is not a right for all.[66]

Moreover, the reform introduces a new threshold which grants the asylum applicant the right to free legal assistance by the Agency only if an appointment – during which the applicant exercises their right to be heard – is scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) after having been notified by the BFA of the intention to reject the asylum application. This means that, if the BFA grants the asylum applicant the right to be heard at a later stage (e.g. in 4 or 5 days), free legal assistance by the Agency will only be available if resources so allow. Consequently, there is a risk of arbitrary access to free legal assistance at first instance which will largely depend on the BFA’s goodwill allowing the asylum applicant to be heard in due time.

The BBU GmbH has some AMIF funded capacities in first instance and provides open counselling in first instance as long as “possibilities are available”. The counselling services are provided at the buildings of the regional directorates of the BFA. There is no funding for transportation costs for persons willing to receive counselling at this stage. At first instance, the BBU GmbH has the legal obligation to provide legal counselling in all procedures where the first interview by the BFA is conducted within 72 hours. In these procedures, the counsellors of the BBU also have to take part in the interviews carried out with the BFA. At the time of writing, this concerned mainly subsequent applications, fast-track procedures and procedures at the airport. The BBU GmbH is not being appointed in Dublin cases by the BFA and therefore is not involved in interviews in these procedures in general in first instance.

It should be noted, however, that the previous legal aid-system in place until the end of 2020 did not meet the needs of asylum seekers either. VMÖ, which received most of the funding for legal assistance in the first instance procedure,[67] was criticised for not being very helpful nor committed to the protection of the rights of asylum seekers due to its cooperation with the Ministry of Interior.[68]

While the BBU GmbH is a federal agency owned by the Ministry of Interior, the head of legal counselling (and the counsellors themselves) are not bound by directives of the CEO of the BBU GmbH. The head of legal counselling is appointed by the Ministry of Justice and has the technical supervision, while administrative/disciplinary supervision lies under the responsibility of the CEO of BBU GmbH. This fairly complex construction should prevent pressure and interference from the Ministry of Interior (which is also the head of the BFA) on the legal counselling unit.

Even though some improvements were achieved in comparison to the previous dysfunctional legal aid system (e.g. trainings of legal advisors, legal aid in front of the High Courts, setting up quality standards), the centralised legal aid system under the BBU GmbH is very fragile from a fundamental rights perspective. The Ministry of Interior still has the right to nominate half of the members of the supervisory board, even if it only appointed two external experts in 2020. An expert board was founded to establish counselling standards.

In December 2023, the Constitutional Court issued a decision declaring the central legislative act of the BBU-G not in accordance with the Austrian constitution. The independence of legal advice for asylum seekers and aliens by the Federal Care Agency is only laid out in the form of a contract between the Agency and the Ministry, but not adequately guaranteed by law, which is why the right to an effective legal remedy is violated. The corresponding provisions in the BBU Establishment Act (BBU-G) and the BFA Procedural Act (BFA-VG) are repealed as unconstitutional. The Constitutional Court has ruled that the legislative bodies have until July 1, 2025 to introduce new legal regulations, otherwise the central legislative act of the BBU-G will be out of force by this date and hence the BBU GmbH will no longer be allowed to conduct legal assistance.

Indeed, due to several complaints from asylum seekers against the findings of the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG), the Constitutional Court had concerns as to whether the provisions regarding the provision of legal advice and representation by the Federal Agency for Care and Support Services (BBU GmbH) complied with the constitutional requirements of Article 47 of the EU -Fundamental Rights Charter (right to an effective remedy) and Article 20 B-VG (administration of bodies that are fundamentally bound by instructions).

In the view of the Constitutional Court, the prerequisite for effective legal protection is that the BBU’s legal advisors are not subject to instructions and are independent, particularly from the Minister of the Interior, who is responsible for enforcing immigration law. The independence of legal advisors is enshrined in law. However, the position of the legal advisors in the BBU and in relation to the Minister of the Interior, who acts as the owner’s representative in the BBU under company law, is spelled out in more detail in a contract. But, by concluding this framework agreement, the management of the BBU is bound to instructions from the Minister of the Interior (together with the Minister of Justice) in terms of corporate law. The contractual regulation is therefore not sufficient to effectively implement the independence of legal advice.

Conversely, the private law structure of BBU GmbH as such is found to be constitutional. The legal advice and representation designed in this way does not represent functional state administrative management within the meaning of Article 20 Paragraph 1 B-VG. The legislature does have a legal entity controlled by the state to provide legal advice and representation. However, this activity is a service for the affected asylum seekers and aliens to enforce their rights in asylum and alien law procedures, which can also be provided (and is also provided) by private individuals. The provisions regarding legal advice and representation by the BBU therefore do not violate Article 20 Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 B-VG.[69]

Legal assistance in appeals
Legal aid provided by the new BBU GmbH since 2021

The BBU GmbH counselling unit is now composed of former employees of Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst and VMÖ. The BBU GmbH was obliged to offer jobs to all employees of the latter organisations. As of September 2023, a total of 140.2 full time equivalents of counselling staff was employed by the BBU GmbH.[70] While in the past legal advisers did not have to meet specific qualifications or training standards, all future advisors must hold a degree in law from an Austrian University and have completed a compulsory internship at a court. These requirements do not apply, however, to all previous staff already employed at VMÖ and ARGE organisations.[71]

As opposed to the previous legal aid system where the contract between the service providers and the government did not foresee quality standards for the provision legal aid, the new contract between the BBU GmbH and the government has improved this aspect.[72] A particular concern was the fact that the quality of legal aid provided by VMÖ largely depended on the individual counsellor. The head of the counselling unit established a formation and training process consisting of three stages. In the third stage new counsellors work under supervision and receive permission to counsel on their own after positive evaluation. The formation and training course partly involves external experts and judges from Court and was also evaluated by the Qualitätsbeirat, an advisory council of the BBU GmbH.[73]

The tasks of the BBU GmbH include counselling, representation and explanation of judgements. The law requires counselling to be ‘objective’. The advisors will have to explain the perspective the applicants have. If the applicants request representation, the advisors have to act in favour of partisan interests. The main tasks will consist in writing appeals as legal representatives and representation in court sessions. The mandate prescribed by law ends upon receipt of the final decision of the Court, although the BBU GmbH must then still explain the content of the judgement and explain the perspectives. As the provision of legal aid must also meet the conditions of Article 47 of the EU Charter, it must ensure an effective access to the High Courts. Upon request by the applicants in cases where the judgement has chances to be overruled by the High Courts, the BBU GmbH must support the applicants in obtaining free legal aid from the normal legal aid system.

One project run by Caritas Austria offers assistance during the hearing before the Federal Administrative Court, but this resource is limited and therefore only a certain number of cases can be assisted. AMIF funding is no longer guaranteed but the project continues on a smaller scale with alternative funding. It also worked on a very small scale during 2022.[74]

Besides this free legal advice funded by the state, NGOs help asylum seekers lodging appeals and submitting written statements, accompany them to personal hearings at the Federal Administrative Court and may act as legal representatives. NGOs cannot represent asylum seekers before the Constitutional Court or the Administrative High Court, as this can only be done by an attorney-at-law.

Legal assistance free of charge is provided in case of the rejection of a subsequent asylum application on res judicata grounds too. The Constitutional Court and the Administrative High Court apply a merits test and tend to refuse free legal aid, if the case has little chance of succeeding. The BBU-G introduces a worrying change in this regard. The law only includes an obligation to inform applicants of the prospects of success of their appeal without stipulating any consequences. However, the approach suggested by the impact assessment of the law, if applied in practice by the Federal Agency, is extremely problematic. Whereas the recast APD does not specify which other authorities could be considered competent to apply a merits test, entrusting the Federal Agency with that task will create an obvious conflict of interest. Moreover, where another authority than a court or tribunal carries out a merits test, the applicant must have the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal against that decision, according to Article 20(3) recast Asylum Procedures Directive. If in practice the Federal Agency were to refuse free legal assistance and representation on that basis without the applicant having an effective opportunity to challenge that decision before a court or tribunal, there would be a clear breach of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive.

The centralisation of legal aid and founding of the BBU GmbH significantly restricts the potential role for and funding of civil society organisations. Since the beginning of 2021, only 10% of the staff of Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst were still employed as a result of the contract cancellation in 2020. Funding remains a difficult topic for non-governmental counselling organisations. As of December 2023, there are still several NGOs such as Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst, Caritas (active in Lower Austria, Vienna, Vorarlberg), Integrationshaus Wien, Deserteurs- und Flüchtlingsberatung, Queer Base, ZEBRA (Graz), Fluchtpunkt Tirol and tralalobe (Vienna) offering legal counselling to asylum seekers.[75]

Considering the fact that the BBU GmbH represents most applicants in the second instance procedure and the continued high rate of overturned decisions, a backsliding compared to the work of its predecessors which used to be responsible for state-provided legal assistance cannot be observed.

In 2023, BBU GmbH provided 21,633 counselling sessions (2022: 17,052) and supported applicants in 8,660 cases (2021: 5.273) to bring an appeal against negative decisions. They represented applicants in 4,917 court hearings (2022: 3,044).[76]

In practice, there is a constant exchange on general topics between the BBU GmbH and NGOs working in the field. There is broad acknowledgement of the well-established practice of counselling performed by the BBU GmbH, but the criticism on the general structure and possible influence by the Ministry of Interior remains. Even the so-called ‘Qualitätsbeirat’, a group responsible for evaluating, observing and providing recommendations to the legal counselling department, stated in its report for 2021 that the current positive development is strongly related to the personalities of the director of the institution and the head of legal counselling, who values and fosters independence in the provision of legal counselling. Nevertheless, the Qualitätsbeirat recommends to take further legislative measures to strengthen the independence of the legal counselling department.[77] In 2022, the Qualitätsbeirat focused on the assessment and improvement of the quality of the counselling provided by the BBU GmbH and on the translation services. It underlined the good quality of the services provided and the good cooperation of the BBU GmbH with the Qualitätsbeirat. Nevertheless it stressed again that legislative changes are necessary to strengthen the independence of the legal counselling department of the BBU GmbH from the Ministry of Interior.[78]  The Constitutional Court`s decision[79] (see Legal assistance at first instance) underlined all this criticism of the structural deficits of the BBU GmbH and found the legislative acts to be unconstitutional. At the time of writing, the government is negotiating a possible amendment of legal counselling within the structure of the BBU GmbH.

DUBLIN IN Austria (C):
General

Dublin statistics: 2023

As of December 2023, Austria carried out 1,240 (2022: 1,100) outgoing Dublin transfers and received 2,166 (2022: 1,575) incoming transfers.[1] In 2023, the main countries receiving outgoing transfers from Austria were Germany (24%), Croatia (21%) and Romania (12%).[2]

In December 2022 Italy announced a temporary stop of Dublin transfers to Italy due to “technical reasons”. There is no official information as to when Dublin transfers to Italy will resume.[3] In 2023, no transfers to Italy took place.

Application of the Dublin criteria
If the special regulation due to threats to public security and order comes into effect (see Access to the Territory), third-country nationals will be returned to neighbouring countries. Since it will not be possible to lodge an asylum application, this will completely contravene the Dublin system.[4]

Austria applies the Dublin procedure systematically and, where it proves impossible to transfer an asylum seeker to one country, examines the criteria of the Regulation to determine whether the person can be sent to another country.[5]

Documentation and entry

The Dublin Regulation may be triggered if there is a so-called “Eurodac hit”, i.e. if the asylum applicant has obtained a visa from another Member State, if the asylum applicant admits that they entered the EU via another Member State or if there is a suspicion or circumstantial evidence indicating the asylum applicant entered via another Member State. Although there are other grounds applicable for determining a Member State’s responsibility under the Dublin III Regulation, these are the most common grounds applied in Austria.

After the CJEU ruling in Jafari,[6] which found that the state-organised transit through the Western Balkan route in 2015-2016 qualified as “illegal entry” under Article 13 of the Regulation, the VwGH dismissed the appeal against a transfer to Croatia on those grounds. The Court did not indicate that Austria applied the discretionary clauses in these cases.[7]

In a case concerning a person who transited through Bulgaria and following a short stay travelled to Serbia and then entered Hungary, without applying for asylum in any of these countries, the Administrative High Court ruled that the provisions of Article 13(1) in conjunction with Article 19(2) of the Dublin III Regulation and in the light of the A.S. ruling of the CJEU, can only be understood as meaning that the criterion of illegal entry, as defined in Article 13(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, is applicable if the asylum seeker did not apply for international protection in that Member State, but if that application was made in another Member State after a short-term voluntary exit to a third country. Bulgaria was therefore deemed responsible for the asylum application.[8]

Family unity

The BFA has put forward surprising arguments in the context of family reunification under the Dublin Regulation. In a case of an unaccompanied minor to whom a protection was granted in Austria, the Greek Asylum Service submitted a “take charge” request for the parents to be transferred from Greece to Austria. The BFA refused responsibility on the ground that the parents had deliberately accepted the separation from their minor child. The rejection of such requests is not considered a formal decision which may be legally challenged before the BVwG. Requests from Greece are also handled very slowly and take often more than a year, which is why Austria ends up being responsible for the asylum application by default. In 2022 Austria received 39 take back and take-charge requests from the Greek Dublin Unit, out of which 14 were accepted. Moreover, a total of 14 transfers were carried out (including transfers pending from the year before).[9] According to Eurostat as reported by Austria, Austria received 44 requests from Greece, including 22 take charge requests and 22 take back requests. Austria decided on 51 requests, potentially including some sent in 2022: 28 take charge and 23 take back requests were accepted. However, only 3 transfers took place in 2023, two based on article 8 (unaccompanied minor with a family member legally present in Austria), and one based on the humanitarian clause.

In 2017, the VwGH examined the question of whether an unaccompanied child could stay in Austria, whilst Italy had been determined as responsible for his family members. Whereas the BVwG had referred to the sovereignty clause of Article 17 of the Dublin Regulation in order to prevent a violation of the right to private and family life, the VwGH stated that Article 11 of the Dublin Regulation prevailed in order to ensure the unity of the family and the best interests of the child.[10]

In 2018, the BvWG had to rule on a case of family reunification concerning parents that had applied for asylum in Austria, while their minor child and the grandmother had applied for asylum in Greece. In accordance with the Dublin III Regulation, Greece requested Austria to be responsible for the applications. However, the BFA had doubts on whether family reunification would be in the best interests of the child and refused to take responsibility. The BVwG confirmed the rejection of the BFA. In the case of refusal of family reunification, the only available option for the requesting Member State is to request a re-examination. As regards the asylum applicant, they cannot act directly against the negative decision nor bring it to appeal, as this is a purely intergovernmental procedure. Therefore, in this case, it was the responsibility of Greece as the requesting Member State to challenge Austria’s refusal to grant family reunification. The revision was rejected by the High Administrative Court.[11]

As a consequence of two cases that asylkoordination österreich had put forward to the Ombudsman, the Minister of Interior and the Ombudsman agreed that the BFA should involve the Child and Youth Welfare Agency when it examines family reunification requests under the Dublin III Regulation to UAMs living in Austria.[12] No changes have been noted in practice, however.[13]

In January 2021, a deportation of a family to Georgia in the middle of the night was debated publicly. One girl was born in Austria and resided in the country over ten years. The case shed light on the fact that children’s rights are often not taken into account in asylum procedures and decisions. The Ministry of Justice introduced a Child Welfare Commission headed by former presidential candidate Irmgrad Griss to evaluate the implementation of children’s rights in asylum procedures.[14] The Commission presented an elaborated report in July 2021 with many recommendations on how the best interest of the child could be guaranteed better in the asylum process, including reception conditions and Dublin III assessment. Recommendations for improvements were presented.[15] In July 2022, the former member of the Commission made a press conference in which they announced that an evaluation done by Asylkoordination, and the Vienna Refugee Law Clinic shows that improvement in practice is still very poor, recommendations are neglected by the authorities. They also demanded the introduction of a permanent monitoring board concerning children’s rights in Austria.[16]

To demonstrate family ties, every asylum applicant must have mentioned the existence of other family members during asylum procedure, in Austria as well as in the other Member States where they have applied for asylum. Marriage certificates or birth certificates are required on a regular basis. Depending on the country of origin, these documents are surveyed by the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation to prove authenticity. Austria requires the original documents, where available, to be sent for verification and does not leave such verification to the other Member States.

DNA tests may be required to provide proof of family ties, but this is rare in practice. DNA tests have to be paid by the asylum seeker. If a DNA test has been suggested[17] by the BFA or the Administrative Court and family links have been verified, asylum seekers may demand a refund of the costs from the BFA. The issue of DNA tests was discussed in the context of a legislative reform affecting Family Reunification but was ultimately not included in the reform.[18]

The High Administrative Court ruled in December 2022 concerning the responsibility of a state for family members: Article 9 of the Dublin III Regulation contains special jurisdiction for family members of beneficiaries of international protection. If the applicant has a family member – regardless of whether the family already existed in the country of origin – who is a beneficiary of international protection and has the right to reside in a Member State, that Member State is responsible for examining the application for international protection, provided that the persons concerned express this wish in writing. This regulation not only allows the persons concerned (the applicant and the beneficiaries of international protection) to have a say, but gives them the power to decide whether they want to be reunited. These rules out the possibility that people are brought together against their will. The applicant must be informed of the requirement for such declarations within the framework of their right to information (cf. Art. 4 Para. 1 lit. b and c Dublin III Regulation) and, in the event of such a request by the applicant, it must be verified that the beneficiaries of the international protection agree to a reunification.[19]

Unaccompanied children

Following the judgment of the CJEU in M.A. which concerned Article 8(4) of the Dublin III Regulation,[20] for asylum applications lodged by unaccompanied children, the BFA has ordered age assessments even in cases where there are no reasons for doubts in regard to the age of the asylum seeker.

In one case concerning a transfer to Hungary, the BFA considered that the deadline for replying to a request should be suspended until an age assessment is conducted. The VwGH disagreed, however, and ruled that the deadline had expired.[21] In 2018, there was another case related to the deadline for replying to a transfer request. In accordance with Article 21 (1) of the Dublin III Regulation, a request for transfer had been send to Croatia. Although the request was incomplete as it was missing the results of the medical age assessment of the child, the BFA considered that the available information was sufficient to conclude that the asylum seeker was an adult. However, the six-month transfer period was not triggered until the age report was received and Austria was therefore deemed responsible for the application.[22]

The VwGH further had to rule on a Dublin transfer to Bulgaria. The case concerned two brothers, one of whom was still a minor. Given that Bulgaria was already responsible for the asylum application of the older brother, the BFA concluded that Bulgaria should also be responsible for the asylum application of the minor, in compliance with the principle of family unity as defined in Article 20(3) of the Dublin III Regulation. The BFA had further assumed the minority of the younger brother without conducting any age assessment. The BVwG overturned the decision and stated that Art. 8(4) applied to the accompanied minor and that, subsequently, the adult was allowed to stay on the Austrian territory in accordance with Art. 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation. However, the VwGH followed the BFA and the adult’s asylum application was rejected in first instance, on the grounds that Bulgaria remained responsible for that application.[23]

The dependent persons and discretionary clauses
Dependent persons

During a Dublin procedure with Italy, the Federal Administrative Court emphasised that Articles 16 (Dependent persons) and 17 (Discretionary clauses) of the Dublin III Regulation determine separate requirements and cannot be reduced to the meaning of Article 8 ECHR. Italy agreed to the Austrian request to take charge of the asylum application only after Austria expressed strong objections due to the fact that Italy had already issued a Schengen visa. The concerned asylum seeker in question was from Chechen origin and aged over 60 years old. He also suffered from a serious illness and a disability which suggested that he relied on support from his son who is legally residing in Austria. The Administrative Court found the decision unlawful and reverted the case back to the first instance authority because Article 16(1) of the Regulation had not been sufficiently considered by that authority. The Court noted, in addition, that Article 17(2) could also be relevant in this case because, due to the Chechen culture, the support of the son for his old parents is more likely to be accepted than foreign support.[24]

This argumentation can be found in another decision of the Court in the case of a single Afghan mother who applied for asylum with a small child and a new-born baby. She had been raped and was suicidal. The judgment held that the authorities should examine which female relatives, living in Austria as recognised refugees, could support her by taking care of the children. Furthermore, the help of females of a family among themselves could be preferred to foreign support based on the applicant’s cultural background.[25] The same argumentation led to the withdrawal of a Dublin decision regarding an Egyptian asylum seeker whose sister required support for her five under-age children after the death of her husband.[26]

A further Dublin decision was regarded as unlawful because a Chechen asylum seeker attempted suicide for the second time after enactment of the notice of transfer to Poland. Therefore, her demand for care and the willingness of her sister, who is living in Austria with refugee status, to take care of her should be examined. Due to the recommendation by a specialist to refrain from a transfer to Poland, it would also be a possibility to make use of the sovereignty clause.[27]

In another case, the BVwG referred to the wording of Art.16(1) of the Dublin III regulation on dependent persons to conclude that this provision also applied to cases in which the asylum applicant provides support to a family member (in the present case, an older brother providing support to his minor sister with special needs). In addition, the Court noted that no investigation on the special needs of the minor was undertaken by the BFA and considered that the responsibility of Italy would breach the ECHR given the particular circumstances of the case.[28]

Humanitarian clause

Austrian authorities make reference to this clause mostly in cases where the asylum applicant is still in another country and applies for reunification with relatives in Austria.

Sovereignty clause

As of August 2023, article 17 Dublin-VO III was applied in 31 cases (2022: 14).[29]

In principle, an asylum seeker has the legal right to request the asylum authorities to implement the sovereignty clause, although this is not specifically laid down in law. The Constitutional Court has ruled, on the basis of case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), that even in case of responsibility of another Member State under the Dublin Regulation, the Austrian authorities are nevertheless bound by the ECHR.[30] This means that, in case of a risk of a human rights violation, Austria has a duty to use the sovereignty clause. This decision is applicable according to Articles 2 and 3 ECHR as well as Article 8 ECHR following an interpretation consistent with the constitution.

However, the assessment of a risk of a human rights violation allowing the use of the sovereignty clause needs be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably delay the examination of the asylum application. The principle that admissibility procedures should not last too long was reflected in a decision of the Administrative Court. A Chechen family had applied for asylum in Poland, Austria and Switzerland by submitting consecutive applications since 2005. One family member was severely traumatised. Switzerland decided on the merits of the case and issued a deportation order before they re-entered Austria. The Court reverted the procedure back to the BFA. The Court found that it would have been necessary to ask for the details of the procedure in Switzerland to prevent indirect violations of Article 3 ECHR through chain deportation. For one family member, the risk of suicide was obvious according to expert statements. The Court, referring to the judgment of the CJEU in the case of NS & ME,[31] held that the long duration of the admissibility procedure has to be taken into consideration when determining the Member State responsible for examining the asylum application and that applying a return procedure in such cases might be more effective.[32]

The sovereignty clause has to be applied in the case of vulnerable asylum seekers to prevent violations of Article 3 ECHR (Article 4 EU Charter). In the case of a refugee from Syria who arrived in Italy in 2013, where he was fingerprinted, but immediately continued to Austria, the Administrative Court agreed that the situation in his country of origin as well as his personal state of stress and uncertainty regarding the situation of his wife and three small children led to an exceptional psychological state with the consequence of several stays in hospital.[33]

In a ruling of January 2017 concerning the transfer of a family including two children to Croatia, the BVwG found that it was irrelevant that the adult brother was not legally responsible for the custody of his minor siblings. As the separation of the adult brother from his minor siblings would constitute an unacceptable interference with the right to family life and the children’s well-being, the application of the sovereignty clause was ordered.[34]

In December 2017, the BFA successfully appealed a decision of the BVwG concerning an unaccompanied child who had been allowed to remain in Austria under the sovereignty clause, while his younger brother was in Bulgaria. The VwGH ruled that the use of the sovereignty clause to prevent a violation of Article 8 ECHR presupposes a correct determination of Austria’s responsibility. The Court found that, if the close relationship between the two brothers would result in Austria not being responsible for the application of the elder brother, then the reference to the sovereignty clause by the BVwG to prevent an Article 8 ECHR violation lacked legal basis.[35]

In another case, the BFA appealed to the VwGH against a decision to transfer a Chechen family to Poland, where the father had already applied and passed the admissibility procedure in Austria. The VwGH found that the applications of the spouse and children should be admitted and the sovereignty clause used in order to preserve family unity.[36]

In several cases, the BVwG has argued that the sovereignty clause may only be applied where a third-country national has lodged an asylum application.

In 2018, Austria made use of the sovereignty clause and accepted to be responsible for the asylum application of a Georgian national, for whom the Czech Republic was initially responsible as she had obtained a visa there. Given that she was the legal guardian of her husband who has special needs and who has obtained the subsidiary protection in Austria, the Court concluded that the asylum seeker should not be separated from her husband and referred to Article 16 of the Dublin regulation on dependent persons as well as to Article 8 ECHR on the right to a private and family life.[37]

Another case in which Austria made use of the sovereignty clause in 2018 concerned a Russian asylum seeker and her two children, who were traveling from Moscow to Vienna. Given that she suffered from different serious illnesses (sclerosis and PTSD), that one of her underage children was mentally ill and that she had relatives in Austria, the BVwG considered that she should stay in Austria and benefit from their support, instead of going to Italy where no one could provide her adequate assistance.[38] In its reasoning, the Court paid particular attention to the child’s best interest (e.g. having adequate support in Austria and the presence of family members).

Moreover, the Constitutional Court held in 2018 that single parents with minor children are considered by Article 21 of the recast Reception Conditions Directive as vulnerable persons.[39] The case concerned an Afghan national and the refusal of the Federal Administrative Court to make use of the sovereignty clause. The latter had refused to recognise the existence of a marriage between the Afghan asylum seeker and her Afghan husband who had obtained the subsidiary protection in Austria, as they were married only under the shariah law in Pakistan. Although their child was born in Austria, the BvWG did not address the vulnerability of the single mother nor the one of the new-born child, despite the situation in Bulgaria as assessed in the AIDA report on Bulgaria (to which the BVwG had made reference).

In September 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled against a decision by BVwG in which the second instance found a planned transfer of a Syrian national to Malta to be admissible. The Syrian national claimed that he would be put in detention upon return to Malta and the conditions in detention in Malta would violate his rights guaranteed by Art 2, 3 ECHR. The BVwG did not assess the situation in detention in Malta and ignored the deterioration following the Covid-19 situation in Malta.[40]

Procedure
Austria has not passed any national legislation to incorporate the Dublin III Regulation, as it is directly applicable, but refers to it in Article 5 AsylG. This provision, together with Article 2(1)(8) BFA-VG, states that the authorities issue an inadmissibility decision when Austria is not responsible for conducting the asylum procedure based on the Dublin III Regulation.[41] In the same decision, the authorities have to declare which Member State is responsible for the examination of the asylum application on its merits.

The law also states that there should also be an inadmissibility decision in case another Member State is responsible for identifying which Member State is responsible for the examination of the asylum application on its merits, that is in cases where the applicant is no longer on Austrian territory.[42]

There are three initial reception centres (EAST) which are responsible for the admissibility procedure: one is located in Traiskirchen near Vienna, one is in Thalham in Upper Austria and one is at the Airport Vienna Schwechat. These centres are specialised in conducting outgoing Dublin procedures.

A central Dublin department in Vienna is responsible for supervising the work of the initial reception centres. Moreover, it conducts all Dublin procedures with regard to incoming Dublin requests (requests to Austria to take back or take charge an asylum seeker by another Member State) and, in response to a request of the Aliens Police department, all consultations with Member States concerning foreigners who have not applied for asylum.

Once an application for asylum is lodged, a preliminary interview by the police (Erstbefragung) takes place on the circumstances of entering Austria and the first country of entry in the EU, the personal data and – in a very brief manner – also on the reasons why an applicant left their home country. The applicant receives a copy of the report and is further fingerprinted and photographed. Fingerprints are taken from all asylum seekers older than 14 years of age. No problems have been reported with regard to the taking of fingerprints. In case an applicant refuses to be fingerprinted, the appeal against a negative decision may not benefit from suspensive effect,[43] but this is not relevant to the Dublin procedure. Due to the increase in applications in summer 2022, non-vulnerable applicants without EURODAC hits were not questioned right at the border but sent to another police directorate in different parts of Austria. The aim was to distribute the work of the police in the province close to Hungary, Burgenland, to other provinces. After the first months of 2023, the police returned to the normal procedure as the number of applications decreased significantly.

Since September 2018, the Aliens Police Department and the BFA are authorised to examine the data storage of persons applying for international protection. However, this interference with the right to privacy is only permitted if the identity or travel route cannot be established on the basis of available evidence. Until the end of 2022, phones and/or other devices containing data of applicants could not be examined by Austrian authorities due to the lack of necessary data protection measures and missing technical equipment.[44] As of September 2023, 16 data storage devices were seized and searched by the BFA .[45]

The asylum seeker receives a green “procedure card” after the public security officer has consulted the BFA about the further steps to be taken in the asylum procedure: admittance to the regular procedure or admissibility procedure. Asylum seekers are transferred or asked to go to the initial reception centres when a Dublin procedure is initiated. The green card permits the asylum seeker to stay in the district of the initial reception centre. Cards for asylum seekers – as well as those granted to beneficiaries of protection – should be designed in such a way that they are counterfeit-proof and have a contactless readable data option.

In every procedure, the BFA has to consider within the admissibility procedure whether an asylum seeker could find protection in a safe third country or another EU Member State or Schengen Associated State.

The VwGH has determined that the deadline for an outgoing request starts running from the registration of the application, i.e. the moment the BFA receives the report of the Erstbefragung, in line with the CJEU ruling in Mengesteab.[46] The case before the VwGH concerned delays in the Erstbefragung, as the asylum seeker had applied for asylum in November 2015 but the preliminary interview only took place in January 2016 and the request was issued in March 2016.

Every asylum seeker receives written information, usually through the form of leaflets, about the first steps in the asylum procedure, basic care, medical care and the Eurodac and Dublin III Regulation at the beginning of the procedure in the initial reception centres. No particular issue in the provision of information have been reported, although it is recommended that providing information orally on top of written information would help asylum seekers to understand the asylum system.

Within 20 calendar days after the application, the BFA has to either admit the asylum applicant to the in-merit procedure or inform the applicant formally – through procedural order – about the intention to issue an inadmissibility decision on the ground that another state is considered responsible for the examination of the asylum claim.[47] The same applies to so called fast-track in-merits procedures. After the requested Member State accepts responsibility, the asylum seeker is given the possibility to be heard. Before that interview, they have an appointment with a legal adviser who must be present at the interview and who can also access documents in the case file.[48] These tasks will be carried out by legal advisors of the BBU as of 2021.

Individualised guarantees
Individualised guarantees were still not requested systematically as of the end of 2020. Their content depends on the individual circumstances of each case according to the BFA. Already in 2017 it was demonstrated that individual guarantees are not requested for vulnerable persons, even where these are requested by legal advisers during the Dublin interview or the appeal before the BVwG. The authorities seem to deem it sufficient to request information from ACCORD or the State Documentation database, in specific cases e.g. access to medical treatment for cancer patients in Italy, and to base their decision thereon.

The sharing of information amongst Member State on the vulnerability and individual guarantees of asylum seekers is still not ensured. In the case of an Iraqi woman in a wheelchair, the BFA obtained a medical report confirming the availability of the necessary medical treatment in Italy. However, Italy had not been informed of the vulnerability in the first round of proceedings, which is why the BVwG granted the appeal and referred the case back to the BFA. The BVwG also rejected the rejection of the BFA in the second stage and stated that Austria was responsible for providing care to avoid a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR under the discretionary clause of Article 17 (1) of the Dublin III Regulation.[49]

Transfers
Transfers are normally carried out without the asylum applicant concerned being informed of the time and the location they are transferred to before the departure from Austria, giving them no possibility to return to the responsible Member State voluntarily.[50] There continue to be reports of the BFA informing receiving countries of a Dublin transfer on very short notice, in some cases no more than a week, even for asylum seekers requiring special care.[51] This raises questions with regard to Recital 24 and Article 26(2) Dublin III Regulation according to which a transfer decision must contain the details of the time carrying out the transfer and “if necessary, contain information on the place and date at which the applicant should appear, if he is travelling to the Member State responsible by their own means.”

In case of an enforced transfer to another EU Member State, the police first apprehend the asylum applicant and transfers them to a detention centre (see Detention of Asylum Seekers).[52] There is also a special detention centre for families in Vienna. The asylum applicant has to stay there until the deportation takes place, usually after one or two days. Under the Dublin procedure, asylum seekers can be held for up to 48 hours without detention being specifically ordered. As a less coercive measure, asylum seekers may be ordered to stay at a certain place (such as a flat or a reception centre).[53] Depending on the responsible state and the number of persons being transferred, the transfer takes place by plane, by bus or by police car under escort.

Regarding detention, the Administrative High Court has stated that the time limit for transfer, which is of 6 weeks, does not start running before the suspensive effect ceases. Furthermore, the period begins running only after the one-week period of the BVwG to award the suspensive effect of the complaint has expired.[54]

No figures on the average duration of the procedure are available. However, the minimum period for a decision to be issued, an appeal to be filed and suspensive effect to be decided upon would be six weeks.

In 2023, 1,240 Dublin-out transfers were conducted.[55] 2,166 Dublin-in transfers were completed in the same time period. As more than 30,000 cases were discontinued due to absconding to other countries, the share of Dublin transfers completed only represents a small part of the applicants. Around 8,000,000 discontinued cases concerned Afghan nationals.

 

Personal interview
After the initial registration process and interview by the police is concluded, another interview conducted by the BFA has to be conducted during admission phase.[56] The law allows for an exception in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure in the initial reception centre (EAST).[57] If the facts are established, and a decision can be taken, the fact that the asylum seeker has not been interviewed yet by BFA or by the BVwG shall not preclude the taking of a decision. In practice this exception is not applied very often.[58] Such relevant facts for a decision in Dublin cases could be a Eurodac hit and the acceptance of the requested Member State to take back the asylum seeker.

The reform of June 2019 establishing the BBU introduces a new threshold which grants the asylum applicant the right to free legal assistance by the Agency only if an appointment – during which the applicant exercises their right to be heard – is scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) after having been notified by the BFA of the intention to reject the asylum application. This means that, if the BFA grants the asylum applicant the right to be heard at a later stage (e.g. in 4 or 5 days), free legal assistance by the Agency will only be available if resources so allow.[59] In practice, the BBU GmbH is notified in some cases and asked to provide legal counselling. There is no official statistics on how many interviews are conducted within 72 hours but in most cases applicants do not have access to legal counselling in Dublin procedures. In practice, legal advisers are present when appointed. But they are often informed only shortly before the interview, which means that they lack time to study the file. In case of detention, legal advice to asylum seekers takes place immediately before the hearing in the detention centre.[60] The provision of § 29 (4) AsylG foresees that an interview may not be conducted by the BFA within the first 24 hours of the asylum application.

In Dublin procedures, the rules and practice are the same as in the Regular Procedure: Personal Interview.

The records of the Dublin consultation between Austria and the requested state(s) are made available to the asylum seeker and the legal adviser only after the procedural order of the intention to reject is given and Austria has received the answer from the requested Member State. Sometimes, the requested State has not received all relevant information. One of the judges of the Federal Administrative Court mentioned in a decision regarding a Chechen father whose son was legally residing in Austria that Italy, which had issued a visa for the couple from Chechnya, finally agreed to take charge but was not informed about the severe illness and the disability of the asylum seeker who relied on the care of his son.[61] The Court noted that the dependency clause should have been applied in this case. In another case which involved Bulgaria, Austria did not inform the authorities that the asylum-seeker had been in Serbia for more than 3 months, although there was enough evidence.[62]

 

Appeal
As Dublin cases are rejected as inadmissible, the relevant rules detailed in the section on Admissibility Procedure: Appeal apply.

The time limit within which the appeal against the BFA’s inadmissibility decisions (including Dublin decisions) must be lodged is 2 weeks. The appeal has no suspensive effect, unless the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) grants suspensive effect within 7 calendar days after the appeal reaches the court.[63] The expulsion order may not be executed before the BVwG has decided if the appeal must be given suspensive effect.[64] In Dublin cases, suspensive effect is hardly granted. Sometimes asylum applicants never receive a final decision because they are transferred back to the responsible Member State before the Court’s decision.[65]

The VwGH dealt with the expiry of the transfer period in the context of an appeal that had a suspensive effect. In that case, the decision that gave the complaint a suspensive effect was taken by written procedure and was notified only after the expiry of the six-month transfer period, as laid down in Article 29 (1) of the Dublin III Regulation. The Court considered that granting a suspensive effect after the expiration of the transfer period is not possible and, as a result, the transfer period cannot be extended. Austria was therefore deemed responsible for the asylum application.[66]

The BVwG can either refuse the appeal, confirming the BFA decision, or decide to refer it back to the BFA with the instruction to conduct either an in-merit procedure or investigate the case in more detail (for instance if the Court finds that the BFA has not properly taken into account family ties or that the assessment of the situation in the responsible Member State was based on outdated material or was insufficient with regard to a possible violation of Article 3 ECHR). The documentation of decisions of the Court shows, that the Court decides on the basis of the written appeal and the asylum file without a personal hearing of the asylum seeker.[67]

In 2018, the Austrian legal information system (RIS) provided a list of 1,284 Dublin cases before the BVwG. 975 of these cases are unsuccessful appeals and confirmed the order to return of the persons concerned. In only 54 cases, the Court finds that the transfer period has already expired and that the procedure should therefore be admitted. In 6,8% of the cases the decision of the BFA was referred back by the court. In 2019, 445 Dublin decisions were appealed. In 62 cases (13,9%), the first instance decisions were referred back to the BFA.[68] In 2021, 770 (2020: 394) Dublin decisions were appealed.[69]

In 2022, 549 Dublin decisions were appealed with the assistance of BBU GmbH.[70]

Asylum seekers whose appeals were accepted by the Court have the right to re-enter Austria by showing the decision of the court at the border. If no suspensive effect was granted but the court finds that the decision of the BFA was unlawful, the asylum seeker is also allowed to re-enter.[71] In practice, it only happens in few cases that suspensive effect is granted after transfer/deportation. No cases were reported to asylkoordination in which re-entering the county was denied in such cases.

 

Legal assistance
Free legal assistance during the admissibility procedure was implemented to compensate for the restricted movement of asylum seekers during this type of procedure, as they are obliged to stay within the district of the initial reception centre (EAST). If asylum seekers leave the district of the EAST to consult an attorney-at-law or NGOs – which normally have their offices in bigger cities – they can be subject to a fine ranging from € 100 to € 1,000. In case of repeated violation of the restricted residence (Gebietsbeschränkung), the fine may reach € 5,000 and detention may even be ordered in case the asylum seeker is unable to pay the fine. A violation of the restriction of movement could furthermore be a reason for pre-removal detention. As of September 2023, in 45 cases a punishment of violation of restricted residence was applied by the authorities.[72] The second reason why free legal assistance is provided at this stage of the procedure is the lack of suspensive effect of an appeal in admissibility procedures, which justifies the incorporation of additional safeguards in the first instance procedure.

As discussed in the section on Regular Procedure: Legal Assistance, the quality of the advice provided raises concerns due to a lack of time of legal advisers and a lack of trust of asylum seekers, as the advisers are considered being too closely linked to the BFA. They have their offices within the building of the BFA, they provide assistance for voluntary return and their task is only to provide objective information about the procedure to the asylum seekers; not to assist them in the procedure and defend their interests. The new system of legal counselling established by the state-owned BBU-GmbH in 2021 further strengthens this conflict of interests, as the Federal Agency responsible for providing legal assistance falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, which is also supervising the determining authority (BFA).

In case of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, the appointed legal adviser becomes their legal representative during the admissibility procedure.[73] There is no legal guardian appointed as the Child and Youth Welfare Authority denies its responsibility arguing that during the admissibility procedure it is not clear whether the children have a perspective to stay in Austria. UAM are not able to act without the consent of their legal adviser, for example to choose a legal representative by themselves or to submit an appeal in case the legal adviser fails to do so. After the admissibility procedure is concluded UAM are supposed to be transferred to the provinces where the authorities of Kinder- und Jugendhilfe take over legal guardianship (see Legal representation of unaccompanied minors).

Although Article 29(4) AsylG provides that free legal assistance shall be provided to all asylum seekers at least 24 hours before the hearing on the results of the evidentiary findings determining the responsible Member State under the Dublin Regulation, legal advisers receive the file only shortly before the interview, therefore lacking time to study the file and prepare for the hearing. Moreover, the reform of the new legal aid system through the BBU-G introduces a new threshold which grants the asylum applicant the right to free legal assistance by the Agency only if an appointment – during which the applicant exercises their right to be heard – is scheduled within 72 hours (3 days) after having been notified by the BFA of the intention to reject the asylum application. This means that, if the BFA grants the asylum applicant the right to be heard at a later stage (e.g. in 4 or 5 days), free legal assistance by the Agency will only be available if resources so allow. The discretion of the BFA as regards the timing of the appointment thus has an influence on whether legal assistance will be provided at first instance because the Federal Agency is legally obliged to do so, or whether it will be provided if the Agency’s available resources allow so. In addition, the provision specifies that, if the asylum seeker did not make use of the right to be heard, this does not affect the outcome of the decision on their application for international protection.[74] NGOs are thus extremely concerned about the arbitrary nature of the provision of legal assistance in such cases. The BBU GmbH reports that if an interview is conducted within 72 hours, they are notified to provide legal counselling. The agency however does not have an overview or information, to what share of Dublin procedures they are involved. The Ministry of Interior also does not provide statistics on the matter. Anecdotal evidence shows that only a small part of the Dublin interviews are conducted within 72 hours and consequently only few applicants confronted with a Dublin procedure have access to free legal counselling.

The legal adviser must be present at the interview held to give the asylum seeker an opportunity to be heard. At the interview in relation to Dublin with the BFA, the asylum seeker together with the legal adviser may submit written statements with regard to the situation in the Member State deemed responsible or make requests for additional investigations, but they are not allowed to ask questions; this is usually respected by the legal advisers.

 

Suspension of transfers

Under the Dublin III Regulation, all EU Member States are considered safe places where the asylum applicant may find protection from persecution. An exception applies to cases in which there is an obvious risk of lack of protection, e.g. if it is well-known to the authorities, or if the asylum applicant brings evidence that there is a risk that they will not be protected properly. This real risk cannot be based on mere speculations, but has to be based on individual facts and evidence. This statement of risk has to be related to the individual situation of the asylum applicant.[75]

Country reports from various sources such as AIDA, UNHCR, the US Department of State, Amnesty International, Eurostat, as well as information from ACCORD and Austrian liaison officers are taken into consideration.

According to the jurisprudence, notorious severe human rights violations in regard of Article 3 ECHR have to be taken into consideration ex officio.[76] If the asylum application is already rejected by the Member State responsible for the examination of the application, a divergent interpretation of the Refugee Convention in a Member State or manifestly unlawful procedures could be relevant in an individual case. Generally low recognition rates in a certain Member State are not regarded as a characteristic of a dysfunctional asylum system.[77]

In 2023, 1,240 outgoing Dublin transfers were completed. The main recipient countries were Germany, Croatia and Romania.

Current practice with regard to selected Dublin countries is illustrated below:

Greece: After the ruling of the ECtHR in M.S.S. v Belgium and Greece in 2011, Austria suspended transfers to Greece. The director of the BFA announced Dublin procedures with Greece would start again in March 2017,[78] in line with the European Commission’s recommendation of December 2016, however they did not resume in practice, including in 2023.There were no take back requests sent to Greece until September 2023.[79] The Austrian authorities sometimes immediately make use of the discretionary clause, but this is not general practice[80] despite the lack of transfers in over 10 years.  There are no Dublin transfers to Greece due to legal reasons.[81] In cases of persons that already have received a protection status in Greece before applying in Austria the situation is different (see Suspension  of returns for beneficiaries of protection in another Member State).

Hungary: In 2019 and 2020, one transfer was reportedly carried out respectively in individual cases. While it is clear that individual guarantees must have been secured for the purpose of this transfer, no further information is available on this case. Until September 2023 2023, 21 (2022: 34) take charge and 2 (2022: 11) take back requests were sent to Hungary. No transfers were completed.[82]

Italy: Until September 2023, 414 take charge and 258 take back requests were sent to Italy. In a letter from December 2022, Italy announced that due to technical reasons no Dublin returnees would be taken back from other countries  At the time of writing, this has not changed and no Dublin returns were completed throughout 2023. Decisions are still being made by the authorities but cannot be implemented.

In the past, the Italian Ministry of Interior had been issuing a number of letters guaranteeing that all families with minors transferred to Italy under the Dublin III Regulation would remain together and be accommodated in a facility adapted to their needs. Previous case law has also allowed for the transfer of families to Italy, including of a single mother and her baby;[83] and of a family with four children (out of which two were minors) and their grandparents.[84] The Constitutional Court also found that the situation of asylum seekers in Italy has improved and that special safeguards are no longer necessary.[85] There is no recent jurisdiction on Dublin returns to Italy by Austrian Courts: Requests are issued and the applicants are only admitted to the procedure when the 6 months have passed. Detentions are generally not upheld as there is no feasible perspective for returns to be resumed.[86]

Bulgaria: Transfers to Bulgaria are carried out by the BFA and generally upheld by the BVwG.[87] The VwGH in 2017 found that the BFA must make a thorough assessment of the conditions in Bulgaria before transferring families.[88] In March 2023, the Constitutional Court annulled two decisions of the BVwG in which the latter found a decision of the first instance determining a transfer to Bulgaria to be lawful. In one case the decision was found to have been taken in an arbitrary manner because the BVwG did not examine whether the person concerned would have an effective access to the asylum system without having to fear of a chain pushback to Türkiye.[89] As a reaction to the High Court’s judgements all appeals concerning Bulgaria were upheld. This changed with the update of the country information sheet provided to the authorities and courts by the Staatendokumentation. There it was stated that Bulgaria is no longer rejecting applications by arguing that Turkey is a safe third county. Following this, the Court’s decisions upheld most first instance decisions and confirmed the legality of Dublin returns to Bulgaria.[90] As of May 2024, Dublin transfers to Bulgaria are conducted and the appeals against negative decisions are dismissed in general.

In 2023, in a case of a single mother with her minor daughter the decision was annulled because the BVwG did not take into account that the persons concerned were members of a vulnerable group.[91] In 2024, in one case in which the applicant claimed to have suffered violence in Bulgaria because of his homosexuality, the appeal was sustained by the BVwG; the decision was annulled and sent back to the first instance for further investigations.[92]

In 2023, around 50% (2022: 70%) of all Austrian take back requests were sent to Bulgaria (6,688). 5,893 (2022: 6,619) were accepted by Bulgaria, 114 (2022: 34) transfers were effectively completed.[93]

Croatia: Following the CJEU ruling in A.S. / Jafari in 2017, the BVwG rejected previously suspended cases and the persons concerned were returned to Croatia. In some cases the applications were admitted in Austria due to the expiry of the time limit for the transfer. Since 2019, transfers to Croatia have been completed without Austria asking for individual guarantees. In a case of an accompanied child that needed medical treatment, the revision was rejected from the High Administrative Court, and an individual guarantee was not deemed to be necessary. Almost all BVwG decisions confirm the first instance decisions that find Croatia responsible.[94] Until September 2023, 57 take charge requests and 821 take back requests were sent to Croatia. In the same time, 196 (2022: 37) transfers were completed to Croatia.[95] In 2023, NGOs reported about many negative Dublin decisions and transfers to Croatia. In all cases, Croatia became responsible by not responding to the requests. Some persons transferred claimed that they have never been to Croatia before.

The situation of Dublin returnees
Asylum seekers returning to Austria under the Dublin Regulation, and whose claim is pending a final decision, do not face obstacles if their transfer takes place within two years after leaving Austria. In this case, the discontinued asylum procedure will be reopened as soon as they request for it at the BFA or the BVwG. If a final decision has already been taken on the asylum application upon return to Austria, the new asylum application will be processed as a subsequent asylum application. Dublin returnees are confronted with the same issues as other asylum seekers in accessing the basic care system. As provinces are reluctant to take over asylum seekers from the federal reception centres Dublin returnees might end up staying several weeks or even months in bigger first reception facilities. .

So far the BFA has not been requested to provide guarantees to other Member States prior to transfers.

# Admissibility procedure
----
ADMISSIBILITY PROCEDURE IN Austria(C):
General (scope, criteria, time limits)

The admissibility procedure starts upon registration of the application with the first interrogation (Erstbefragung) of the asylum seeker by the public security officer, who has to submit a report to the branch office of the BFA. The caseworker of the BFA in charge of the case informs the police about the next steps of the admissibility procedure within 24 hours on average. If the applicant is admitted to the regular procedure they are ordered to travel to the initial reception centre (EAST) or transferred there by the police.[1] There are three EAST which are responsible for the admissibility procedure: one is located in Traiskirchen near Vienna, one in Thalham in Upper Austria and one at the Airport Vienna Schwechat. If the asylum applicant is not admitted to the regular procedure, they stay in the Federal reception system and are not being allocated to one of the provinces. The person has then only the right to stay in the district where the Federal reception centre is located.

All asylum seekers have to undergo the admissibility procedure, except children born in Austria whose parents have received protection status in the country or whose application is admitted to the regular procedure. Their applications are admitted immediately to the regular procedure.[2]

An application may be rejected as inadmissible for the following reasons:

The person comes from a safe third country;[3]
The person enjoys asylum in an EEA country or Switzerland;[4]
Another country is responsible for the application under the Dublin III Regulation;[5]
The person files a subsequent application and “no change significant to the decision has occurred in the material facts”.[6]
Asylum seekers receive a green “procedure card” within 3 days, which is an indication that their stay in Austria is tolerated. This card is replaced by a “white card” as soon as the application is admitted to the regular procedure.

Within 20 days after the application for international protection has been lodged, the BFA must admit the asylum applicant to the in-merit procedure or notify them formally by procedural order about the intention to issue an inadmissibility decision on the ground that another state is considered responsible for the examination of the asylum claim; or that it intends to revoke the suspensive effect of a subsequent application. If the BFA does not notify the asylum applicant of its intention to issue an inadmissibility decision within 20 days, the application is thus admitted to the regular procedure. This time limit does not apply if consultations with another state on the application of the Dublin III Regulation take place.[7]

The 20-day time limit shall not apply if the BFA intends to reject the application for international protection and the applicant does not cooperate during the asylum procedure. The procedure is deemed no longer relevant, especially if the asylum seeker absconded from the procedure.[8] The duty of asylum seekers to cooperate includes the duty to provide the BFA with information and evidence about their identity and reasons for applying for international protection, to be present at hearings and personal interviews as well as to inform the authorities about their address. If the asylum seeker is unable to cooperate during the procedure for reasons relating to their person (e.g. illness, postponing the interview due to duty to comply with summons etc.), the 20-day time limit shall be suspended.[9]

If the BFA has ordered an age assessment, the 20-day time limit also does not apply.[10]

As a result of the admissibility procedure, the application may either be admitted to the regular procedure, dismissed on the merits, or asylum or subsidiary protection status may be granted. The granting of a status or the dismissal of the application in the admissibility procedure replaces the admissibility decision.[11] An admissible application shall nevertheless be rejected if facts justifying such a rejection decision become known after the application was admitted.[12] In practice, this provision is applied in Dublin cases without the precondition that the facts justifying admissibility were not known before.[13]

The information provided by the Ministry of Interior did not include the number of inadmissibility decisions issued in 2019.[14] However, the admissibility procedure lasted for approximatively five days in 2018. This did not significantly change in 2019. It should be noted that, especially in the context of family proceedings, the admission often already takes place on the day of the application, which importantly reduces the calculation of the average duration.[15] It should be further noted that, during the admission procedure, asylum seekers are given basic care in federal care facilities. In 2020, asylum seekers were accommodated in federal facilities and received federal basic care for around 26 days on average.[16] In 2021, the average time of a person (separate data for asylum seekers not available) accommodated in federal basic care is 80 days, compared to 1,033 days in province basic care.[17] As of September 2023, the average time of a person’s accommodation in federal basic care is 123 days (2022: 153 days), compared to 622 days in province basic care (2022: 528 days).[18]

Personal interview
A personal interview is required by law. The asylum seeker is interrogated by law enforcement officials at the registration stage of the application for international protection and a second time by officials of the BFA during the admissibility procedure at the initial reception centre. The police are not allowed to ask detailed questions on the merits of the application such as the specific reasons for fleeing the country of origin or residence. There is a clear division of tasks between the police – which has the duty to assess the identity, personal data and the travel route of the applicant – and the officials of the BFA for assessing the facts on which the application is based. In reality, this sometimes leads to problems: the last question in the questionnaire of the police always concerns the reason why the person had to flee. In most cases, the applicants are told to give a short answer only and more details in a later interview. As a result, the reasons for fleeing the country of origin may be found not credible at the interview stage before the officials of the BFA if the asylum seeker has based the application for international protection on other reasons than those stated immediately upon arrival at the police stage. There is jurisprudence by the High Administrative Court that the evidence gathered in the initial interview at the police shall not be used in an ”unreflective manner” by the authorities and the Court as the initial interview does not focus on the reasons why the person is seeking international protection.[19]

In this regard, Article 19(4) AsylG explicitly foresees that, in the admission procedure, the asylum seeker shall also be informed that their own statements will be accorded particular attention, meaning that they should be aware of the consequences of false testimonies.

The law allows for an exception from the personal interview in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure while being accommodated in the initial reception centre. If the facts relevant to a decision on an asylum claim are established, the fact that the asylum seeker has not been interviewed yet by the BFA or by the BVwG shall not preclude the rendering of a decision. In practice this exception is not applied very often, however. The BFA files most of these cases as “discontinued”, which means that upon request by the asylum seekers the procedure will be reopened. An exception may apply in a subsequent asylum application that was submitted within two days before the execution of an expulsion order.[20] An interview during the admission procedure may be dispensed with if the procedure is admitted.

 

Appeal
For the admissibility procedure, the appeal stages are the same as in the regular procedure. The time limits within which an appeal against the BFA’s inadmissibility decision must be lodged is two weeks and the appeal has in general no suspensive effect, except when decided otherwise by the BVwG.[21]

As a first step, the BVwG decides within one week after receiving the appeal whether the appeal will have suspensive effect during the continuing appeal procedure. If the BVwG does not grant a suspensive effect to the appeal or does not admit the appeal after seven days, the asylum applicant can be transferred to the responsible Member State, the safe third country or their country of origin in case of a subsequent application.

If the application is rejected on the merits in the admissibility procedure and the second instance grants suspensive effect after the appeal was brought in, the granting of suspensive effect also means that the application has been admitted in Austria.[22]

Appeals against a decision rejecting the asylum application as inadmissible do not have suspensive effect unless this is granted by the BVwG.[23] The reasons for not granting suspensive effect to the appeal in inadmissible cases correspond to grounds for declaring claims manifestly unfounded, as mentioned in Regular Procedure: Appeal.

The appointed legal adviser is not obliged to help the asylum seeker to draft the complaint, despite the fact that it must be written in German, and the requested qualification for legal advisers is also not sufficient.

 

Legal assistance
The BBU GmbH as legal adviser is automatically appointed by the BFA in case it intends to reject the application in the framework of the admissibility procedure and if an interview is to be conducted within 72 hours of handing over a procedural order of its intention to reject the application in the admissibility procedure. Legal advice has to be provided at least 24 hours before the second interview, the one with the BFA, during which the asylum seeker is given the opportunity to be heard. If the interview is conducted within 72 hours, presence of legal advisers during the interview is mandatory unless the applicant dismisses the advisor explicitly. If the interview is conducted more than 72 hours after, the BBU will not even be informed of the case until a negative decision is issued.

Free legal advice is foreseen for subsequent asylum applications under the same conditions (interview within 72 hours) as well, including at appeal stage.[24] Most of the cases that are regarded as inadmissible are Dublin cases (see Dublin: Legal Assistance) and Safe Third Country cases.

Since January 2021, legal assistance has been provided by the new Federal Agency, the BBU GmbH (see Regular procedure: Legal assistance).

 

Suspension of returns for beneficiaries of protection in another Member State
There is no general suspension of returns of beneficiaries of protection to any EU member state. In practice, there are mainly cases of Afghan and Syrian nationals with a protection status in either Greece or Bulgaria.

Rejections for existing protection in another EU state are also issued regularly by the BFA concerning countries such as Greece or Hungary, even though the appeal is regularly granted suspensive effect.

Hungary: In a case of a Syrian national who has received subsidiary protection status in Hungary in 2015 and applied for asylum in Austria in 2020, the BVwG rejected the applicant’s appeal.[25] Even though the applicant brought forward that he had no access to support from the state, had to live on the street and was assaulted the Court came to the conclusion that there exist support possibilities from the government and from NGOS and that there is no real-risk of an Art 3 ECHR violation.

Greece: There is no general policy of suspension of transfers of BIPs to Greece. Applications by beneficiaries of international protection in Greece have risen since 2020. While the first instance authority initially admitted vulnerable cases to the asylum procedure, a change of strategy was observed throughout 2021. Until then, in general, in single cases where protection status was granted by Greek authorities, the Courts rejected applications lodged in Austria. This changed in June 2021 as the Constitutional Court ruled that, due to inadequate reception conditions in Greece a thorough assessment has to be carried out before transferring beneficiaries of international protection back to Greece.[26] the Constitutional Court suspended the decision of the Federal administrative court which had rejected an appeal from an Afghan woman who received asylum status in Greece in 2019 and applied for asylum in Austria in 2020. Looking at the recently updated AIDA country report on Greece, the Constitutional Court considered that the applicant may face a risk of violation of Art 3 ECHR violation and ordered further examinations on the access to food, shelter and sanitary facilities. The decision set out a benchmark as it was done in plenary of the Constitutional Court. Following this decision, the BVwG reconsidered several first instance decisions based on insufficient information on the situation in Greece.[27] A project called “Tetraa” was initiated by asylkoordination together with Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst and lawyer Christian Schmaus. In this project, strategic litigation is being conducted focusing on asylum procedures of beneficiaries of International protection in Greece coming to Austria applying for asylum because of dire living conditions in Greece.[28]

There is an examination of the individual cases and communication with the Greek authorities.  However, in at least one case a person who had received subsidiary protection in Greece and whose application was rejected in Austria, was deported to Greece in 2022.[29] There was no transfer in 2023. In the particular case of 2022, the case is still pending at the Constitutional Court in Austria at the time of writing.

Also in 2023, the Constitutional Court upheld the appeals in two cases due to lack of investigations concerning access to basic care systems[30] and in a case of a pregnant applicant with a recognised refugee status in Greece.[31] The Federal Administrative Court had wrongly based the rejection of the applications on the fact that the applicant is based in Austria due to her residence permit and will not be transferred to GR anyway. Therefore the decision would be a “purely hypothetical “Return” act. The Constitutional Court found that the general reference to the reporting situation is insufficient.

Bulgaria: There is also some case-law regarding beneficiaries of international protection in Bulgaria who come to Austria to lodge a new application. In 2016, a Syrian mother with 3 children gave birth after she arrived in Bulgaria where she suffered from prenatal depression. She was granted subsidiary protection in Bulgaria shortly after moving to Austria. The Bulgarian authorities denied responsibility under the Dublin system, but were ready to take over as a result of the readmission agreement. The BVwG considered the deportation to Bulgaria as not permissible because of the PTSD from which the children were suffering and which was triggered, among other things, by experiences during the imprisonment in Bulgaria at the end of September 2015, as well as the intensive family relationship with relatives living in Austria.[32] In 2023, the BVwG granted suspensive effect in several cases concerning Bulgaria and appeals were upheld as the investigations of the first instance concerning living conditions were not thorough enough.[33]

The BVwG has also accepted an appeal of an Afghan family in 2017 who had received subsidiary protection in Hungary, due to the need to clarify whether the current situation of beneficiaries of protection in Hungary raises a risk of violation of Article 3 ECHR.[34] In the case of a single Syrian who obtained subsidiary protection in Bulgaria, however, the BVwG found no real risk on the ground that he did not belong to a vulnerable group.[35]

# Border procedure (border and transit zones):
----
BORDER PROCEDURE (BORDER AND TRANSIT ZONES) IN Austria(C):
General (scope, time limits)

The law provides for “procedures for the imposition of measures to terminate residence” subject to reduced time limits for appeal and decisions on appeal, with the effect that certain cases are dealt with in an accelerated manner. For the purpose of this report, these are referred to as accelerated procedures.

Under Article 27 AsylG, an accelerated procedure is applied where:

During the admissibility procedure, the BFA has notified the applicant of its intention to reject the application as inadmissible (see section on Admissibility Procedure) or dismiss the application on the merits;[1]
The appeal procedure is to be discontinued where the asylum seeker has absconded the procedure and a return decision was issued by the BFA;[2]
The BFA determines that the application should be rejected as inadmissible or dismissed on the merits and there is a public interest in accelerating the procedure.[3] Public interest exists in particular, albeit not exhaustively, where an applicant:[4]
Has committed a criminal offence;
Has been charged with a criminal offence by the Department of Public Prosecution;
Has been subject to pre-trial detention; or
Has been caught in the act of committing a criminal offence.
In case a “procedure for the imposition of measures to terminate residence” has been initiated, a decision on the asylum application shall be taken as quickly as possible and no later than 3 months.[5]

In addition, Article 27a AsylG provides an accelerated procedure as such and states that certain cases may be decided within 5 months, with a possible extension if necessary for the adequate assessment of the case. Such accelerated procedures are foreseen when grounds for denying the suspensive effect of appeals apply, as stated in Article 18 BFA-VG. These reasons are:

The asylum seeker comes from a safe country of origin;
There are indications that the asylum seeker endangers public security and order;
The asylum seeker has provided false statements on their identity, nationality and authenticity of documents;
No reasons for persecution have been asserted;
Statements adduced are obviously false or contradictory;
An executable return decision has been issued before applying for international protection; and
The asylum seeker refuses to provide fingerprints.[6]
Procedures are also subject to stricter time limits in case the asylum application is examined at the airport (see section Border Procedure).

By law, no vulnerable groups are automatically exempted from accelerated procedures. There is no information available as to a general practice on the matter.

In 2020, 524 applications were subject to an accelerated procedure with an average duration of less than 72 hours. Another 283 procedures were conducted as classic fast track procedures with an average duration of 22.7 days.[7] In accelerated procedures, the authorities focus on applicants from countries with a low recognition rate. In 2020, the top three nationalities to be confronted with accelerated procedures were Morocco (55%), Algeria (18%) and India (5.8%).[8] In 2021, 1,100 cases were channelled into the accelerated procedure. In 2022, 23,297 decisions were taken in a fast track procedure, among which 1,188 were taken in an accelerated procedure. The top three nationalities concerned were India (30%), Tunisia (29%) and Morocco (17%). In 2023, 8,421 decisions were taken in a fast track procedure, among which 300 were taken in an accelerated procedure. The top three nationalities processes in fast track procedures were Morocco (84%), India (16%) and Pakistan (9%).[9] These procedures are not necessarily conducted at the border.[10]

Personal interview
All asylum seekers must conduct a personal interview. The law permits an exception in case the asylum seeker has absconded from the procedure.[11] If the facts are established, failure by the BFA or by the Federal Administrative Court to conduct an interview should not preclude the rendering of a decision. No differences are observed from the Regular Procedure: Personal Interview.

The BFA may omit the personal interviews in cases of subsequent applications which aim to prevent the execution of an expulsion order and/or subsequent applications without de facto protection against deportation. Subsequent applications within 18 days of the deportation date have no suspensive effect, the expulsion order issued after the rejection of the first asylum application can be executed.[12]

 

Appeal
Time limits for appeals are the same as in the Regular Procedure: Appeal. The BVwG has to decide on the appeal within 3 months in cases granted suspensive effect.[13] The BVwG has to decide on the appeal against negative decisions – which include expulsion orders – within 8 weeks.[14]

In subsequent applications without protection against deportation, the court has to decide within 8 weeks if suspensive effect was not granted. This provision has not much effect in practice, however, as asylum seekers may have been expelled or transferred before. Nevertheless, the appeal may have suspensive effect.[15]

Difficulties in lodging an appeal against negative decisions in the accelerated procedure are similar to those described in the section on the Dublin Procedure: Appeal; especially regarding the lack of free legal assistance. Organisations contracted to provide legal assistance also have to organise interpreters if necessary.

Legal assistance
Access to free legal assistance at first instance is difficult for asylum seekers detained during the accelerated procedure, although they may contact NGOs for advice. Free legal assistance is available for subsequent asylum applications too.[16] Since January 2021, the Federal Agency (BBU-GmbH) is responsible for providing legal assistance also in these cases.

A right to legal advice – as required by the recast Asylum Procedures Directive – is only mandatory at second instance, i.e. before the BVwG. This means that, at first instance, legal assistance will only be provided depending on existing resources of the Federal Agency.[17] As a result, it is not guaranteed that asylum applicants in the accelerated procedure will have effective access to legal assistance. Moreover, while they are in principle allowed to access other NGOs, the restriction on their freedom of movement in the context of the admissibility procedure (see Freedom of movement) significantly limits their access to NGOs which are not present in certain initial reception centres.

In so-called accelerated procedures under Article 27a AsylG in conjunction with Article 18 BFA-VG, mandatory free legal aid for the admissibility procedure is circumvented by the possibility to forward the procedure to the BFA branch office without prior admission to the regular procedure. This practice took place from time to time in 2018 but has not been reported recently. When asylum seekers get an invitation to their interview, they are still subject to restrictions on their freedom of movement. Therefore they are not able to consult NGOs or lawyers outside the restricted area. The BBU GmbH had access to accelerated procedure applicants. However, they were not allowed to share information on the concrete circumstances due to their legal obligations set out in the BBU-G.

D. Guarantees for vulnerable groups
# Identification
----
IDENTIFICATION IN Austria(D):
The Asylum Law has no definition of vulnerable groups. However, it provides special provisions for victims of harassments, of crimes against sexual self-determination (Article 20 Asylum Act), of violence (Article 30 AsylG), as well as for unaccompanied minors (e.g. family tracing Article 18, legal representation Article19 Asylum Law). Only a few federal states such as Burgenland, Vorarlberg or Upper Austria have included definitions of vulnerable asylum seekers in their basic care laws.

Screening of vulnerability
There is no effective system in place to identify asylum seekers in need of special procedural guarantees and the law does not foresee any mechanism to that end. During the admissibility procedure in the initial reception centre, asylum seekers are informed through written leaflets about the necessity to report psychological problems to the doctor and the legal adviser. At the beginning of the  all interviews in the asylum procedure it is foreseen that the applicants are asked whether they have any health or mental problems that could influence their ability to cooperate during the asylum procedure. In individual cases psychologists in initial reception centre are requested by the BFA to assess if the asylum seeker is suffering from mental disorders as a result of torture or another event which may prevent them from defending their interests during the procedure or entails for them a risk of permanent harm or long-term effects.[1]

The report published by the OHCHR in October 2018 following a mission in Austria indicates that interviews conducted by the police and the BFA take place in an atmosphere of mistrust, whereby the authorities focus on the identification of Dublin cases rather than on the identification of vulnerability. The report also stated that there was generally little cooperation among different actors, including governmental entities and a broad range of civil society organisations working with migrants in vulnerable situations.[2] In 2021, the exchange between the first instance authority and NGOs remained difficult. In 2023, there were meetings between NGOs such as asylkoordination österreich and Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst who were received by the Director of the BFA. In several regional directorates such as Carinthia there are regular exchange meetings between the authority and NGOs. There is however an exchange between NGOs, second instance Court and the BBU GmbH on a regular basis.

Victims of trafficking

In the Austrian system, there is no systematic identification of victims of trafficking. However, an Austrian authority’s assessment of an individual as a (potential) trafficked person has concrete consequences in status determination procedures and criminal prosecution; meaning that a person can be identified as a victim of trafficking in accordance with the criminal procedures act. A type of formal classification of an individual as a “victim” and the procedural consequences this entails is only regulated in the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure.

The OHCHR further encouraged the Austrian authorities to provide for a reflection and recovery period in the law in order to strengthen identification practices, but this was not implemented. During its visit in 2018, the OHCHR was informed that potential victims of trafficking, particularly women were being returned back to the countries they had fled. This mainly concerned Dublin cases and “safe third country” cases.[3] In practice, there are still no systematic identification of victims of trafficking in place. In November 2021, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented the 6th national action plan to combat trafficking in human beings for 2021 to 2023, consisting of 109 measures ranging from prevention and awareness raising to improving law enforcement measures.[4]

In practice, if an Austrian official, such as a caseworker of the BFA, identifies a potential trafficked person, the official is requested to contact the criminal police office of the respective federal province. If the latter confirms the suspicions of the official, criminal investigations are initiated. The individual concerned as well as a specialised NGO will be contacted and informed, a reflection period may be granted, and certain victims’ rights relevant to criminal proceedings are provided.[5] There are no current statistics, however, on the number of victims of human trafficking in Austria.

Access to specialised care and support through NGOs is not necessarily dependent on informal identification by the police or the presence of criminal or civil proceedings. In the identification process, a central role is given to the Federal Criminal Intelligence Service. Together with its offices in the federal provinces, it is responsible for investigating cases of trafficking in Austria. This authority mainly cooperates with the organisation “LEFÖ-IBF”, which is formally contracted by the Austrian Ministry of Interior and the Women’s Department of the Federal Chancellery to provide support and protection to victims of trafficking across Austria.

Age assessment of unaccompanied children
Most age assessments are ordered by the BFA during the admissibility procedure, as special safeguards apply to unaccompanied children in accordance with the Dublin III Regulation. When the Dublin Unit starts consultations with other EU Member States it thus informs the latter that there is an ongoing age assessment procedure. In the meantime, the concerned unaccompanied children are admitted to the regular asylum procedure.

The BFA had ordered 1,355 carpal x-rays in 2017 and 2,552 age assessments in 2016; resulting in the recognition of minority of 61% and 59% respectively.[6] In 2022, 461 (2021: 428) multifactorial age assessments and 951 (2021: 1,170) wrist X-rays were conducted by the BFA. As a result of age assessments, in 233 cases (2021: 200) the applicant was considered to be of age while in 228 (2021: 228) cases the applicant’s minority was confirmed.[7] In 2023, there were 4,946 applications of unaccompanied minors in Austria. In less than 10% of the cases (489), a multifactorial age assessment was conducted. In 56,2% of the cases the result was that the applicant was not found to be a minor (275 cases).[8]

Methods for assessing age

In the case of doubt with regard to the age of an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child, authorities may order a medical examination. Several methods might be used. According to the Asylum Act and decrees of the Minister of Interior (which are not public), age assessments through medical examination should be a measure of ultima ratio. Other evidence to prove age should be verified first. If doubts remain after investigations and age assessment, the principle of in dubio pro minore (the benefit of the doubt) should apply.[9] As part of a multifactorial examination methodology, three individual examinations are carried out (i.e. physical, dental and x-ray examinations). According to the Ministry of Interior, these examinations are conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Association for Forensic Age Diagnostics (AGFAD).[10]

However, these principles are not strictly applied in practice. Children undertake age assessment tests but the asylum authorities do not acknowledge the documents that are submitted to them nor do they allocate sufficient time to obtain such documents. The Human Rights Board (Menschenrechtsbeirat), NGOs and the Medical Association have criticised the age assessment methods.[11] The age assessment examination states a minimum age and consists of three medical examinations: a general medical examination; an X-ray examination of the wrist and a dental examination by a dentist. If the X-ray examination of the wrist is not conclusive, a further X-ray (CT) examination of the clavicle may be ordered.

In 2017, there was an example in which the VwGH applied the benefit of the doubt and ruled that the applicant should be considered to be a minor, concerning a Gambian asylum seeker. His birth certificate, delivered by the Gambian authorities, indicated that he was a minor but the authorities in Norway and Italy had determined that he was an adult. The BFA considered that the concerned Gambian applicant was between 17.04 and 18.44 years.[12]

Even though strategic litigation against the application of age assessment has almost ceased in the last years, concerns are being articulated by NGOs especially in reference to the indiscriminate application of age assessments.[13] The BFA regularly orders age assessment procedures, even in cases in which the applicants offered to present documents within days or weeks. The costs of an age assessment range between € 489.20 and € 1,246.80.[14] The statistical data of the Ministry of Interior is incomplete and does not allow conclusions to be drawn on the proportionality and scientific value of the application of age assessment.

Challenging age assessments

Age assessments are not an administrative decision but an expert opinion which is communicated to the applicant. As a result, there is no possibility to appeal the opinion. The question whether it is possible to challenge the decision declaring the majority of an asylum applicant has been referred to the Constitutional Court (VfGH). In a ruling of 3 March 2014, the Court ruled that the declaration of majority of an asylum applicant by the BFA, and the subsequent discharge of the legal representative, may not be appealed during the first instance procedure.[15] As a consequence, unaccompanied children who are erroneously declared to be adults have to continue the procedure without legal representation. Authors have raised concerns resulting from this ruling, in particular the fact that the Court established criteria that are not in line with the applicable legal safeguards and disregarded the significant procedural consequences a declaration of majority entails. [16]

The VwGH has confirmed the VfGH’s position, stating that age assessments should be seen as part of the examination of the asylum application. Since the age assessment is a mere procedural matter according to the VfGH, the asylum seeker does not lose any rights in the procedure that they would otherwise enjoy as an unaccompanied child.[17]

However, as explained by experts, the deprivation of the right to legal representation under Article 10(3) BFA-VG denies unaccompanied children of the right to a representative in violation of Article 25(1) of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive and Article 6(2) of the Dublin III Regulation, as well as of Article 24(1) of the recast Reception Conditions Directive.[18]

# Special procedural guarantees
----
SPECIAL PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES IN Austria(D):
Adequate support during the interview

In cooperation with UNHCR Austria, IOM and LEFÖ BFA, officials of the BFA are offered training sessions providing targeted information on vulnerable groups.[1] These trainings further aim to strengthen their understanding of first-instance procedures and adequate measures to be adopted to ensure a high-quality of interpretation.[2] In addition to the trainings that have been organised on a regular basis since 2016, officials of the BFA are also supported in their day-to-day work through the development of certain tools. UNHCR further develops specific assessment methods for the evaluation of asylum procedures. It selects the focus point for the assessment of the decisions and provides samples of interviews and decisions to train quality assessors of the BFA accordingly. In 2018, two cases involving homosexual asylum applicants aroused public criticism. Social media reported that their asylum application had been rejected as untrustworthy, which led to an investigation and the responsible official of the BFA lost his license to decide upon asylum applications. The BFA acknowledged that the decision did not meet the necessary qualitative standards as regards language and wording used.[3]

In that context, the Austrian Queer base counselling centre criticised the fact that BFA employees were not adequately trained in that regard. The Ministry of Interior responded that there are ongoing training courses offered to BFA staff and highlighted that specific trainings on LGBTI rights had been planned even before the aforementioned scandal.[4] Since 2019, there is a course offered by the BVwG for its judges in cooperation with the LGBTIQ-organisation Queer Base. This is not mandatory for the judges. In addition, as part of the annual training programme for BFA employees a course presented by Queer Base is offered for dealing with particularly vulnerable groups in order to meet the special needs necessary sensitivity when identifying particularly vulnerable people and their special interests in the context of asylum and immigration law procedures.[5]

In the past there were several cases in which it became public that decisions of the BFA were based on personal views and involved biased questioning in interviews as well as stereotypes on gender and race.[6] In 2021, in one case in which the NGO Queer Base represented the applicant was made public: The BFA had used inappropriate and inadequate questions concerning the sexual life of the applicant and had made the applicant undress according to her.[7]

If an asylum seeker bases the fear of persecution on infringements of their right to sexual self-determination, they should be interviewed by an official of the same sex, unless requested otherwise.[8] In the procedure before the BVwG, this rule should apply only if asylum seekers have already claimed an infringement of their right to sexual self-determination before the BFA or in the written appeal. The Constitutional Court (VfGH) has ruled that a judge of the same sex has to decide on the appeal regardless of whether a public hearing is organised or the decision is exclusively based on the file.[9] A similar provision for interpreters is lacking, however.

Each member of a family has to submit a separate application for international protection. During the interview they are asked whether they have individual reasons to apply for protection or whether they want to rely on the reasons of one of their family members. Accompanied children are represented in the procedure by their parents, who are requested to submit the reasons on behalf of their children.

Exemption from special procedures
If it is deemed highly probable that the applicant has suffered from torture or other serious forms of physical, psychological or sexual violence, the application shall not be dismissed in the admissibility procedure.[10]

Moreover, asylum claims lodged by vulnerable asylum seekers (e.g. victims or torture or violence and unaccompanied children) should in principle not be processed in airport procedures. However, in practice, in the absence of effective vulnerability identification mechanism, vulnerable applicants continue to be subject to airport procedures. Moreover, vulnerable applicants may also be subject to accelerated procedures for national security reasons.[11]

# Use of medical reports
----
USE OF MEDICAL REPORTS IN Austria(D):
Asylum seekers undergo a mandatory medical examination in the initial reception centres (EAST).[1] In many cases, however, persons of trust are not allowed to be present during psychological consultations.

Medical reports are mainly requested in the admissibility procedure to assess whether an expulsion would cause a violation of Article 3 ECHR. Therefore, a standard form is used with space for a narrative. Medical reports are not based on the methodology laid down in the Istanbul Protocol.[2]

Some of the psychiatrists or medical experts are accredited by the courts, but have no special training on survivors of torture, do not apply the Istanbul Protocol, do not allow a person of confidence to be present during the examination or are biased. Therefore asylum seekers also submit opinions of experts of their own choice, which they normally pay themselves, although sometimes these opinions are covered by their health insurance.

The Administrative Procedures Act (AVG) requires the assessment of all relevant facts and imposes an obligation on the authorities to undertake all necessary investigations. Statements of the applicants have to be credible, persecution needs not be proved and preponderant plausibility is sufficient. If the authorities have doubts on whether the applicant has been subjected to torture or other serious acts of violence, a medical examination may be ordered. These examinations are paid by the state. Often asylum seekers submit expert opinions e.g. a report of the psychiatric department of a hospital where they have been treated or an opinion of a psychotherapist. In each federal state, a network of NGOs provides free psychotherapy sessions to asylum seekers, as these are funded by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). [3] However, in practice, capacities are insufficient and clients often have to wait several months to start the treatment.[4]

In appeal procedures against a decision of the BFA, new facts and evidence may be submitted only if the asylum seeker had been unable to submit those before the BFA. Negative first instance decisions are often based on the lack of credibility of the facts presented. To convince the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) of the applicant’s credibility, expert opinions requested by the Court or submitted by the applicant may thus play a crucial role in the appeal procedure.

The Administrative High Court (VwGH) delivered a crucial decision in 2010 with regard to the consideration of medical evidence, in which it criticised the first instance authority for: “[N]eglecting to take into account medical reports as proof of psychological conditions, which consequently deprived the applicants of an objective examination of contentious facts…The responsible authority has thereby judged the applicants’ mental state without going into the substance of the individual circumstances.”[5] A psychiatric opinion was taken into consideration, which concerned the need to treat the psychiatric illness. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), illusions and concentration difficulties were diagnosed, but the opinion did not demonstrate to what extent those issues would influence the asylum seeker’s statements. Therefore, the authority believed that the asylum seeker should remember the exact date of the events reported.

The established jurisprudence of the VwGH requires exhaustive reasoning to deny the causality between alleged torture and visible scars, including through an expert opinion indicating the likelihood of alleged torture causing the visible effects.[6] In the same ruling, the Court repeated earlier jurisprudence to the effect that psychiatric illness has to be taken into account in regard to discrepancies that have been identified in the statements of an asylum seeker.

# Legal representation of unaccompanied children
----
LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN Austria(D):
A legal representative for the asylum procedure is appointed by the BFA as soon as an unaccompanied child applies for asylum.[1] As opposed to adult asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors have to lodge the asylum application at a specific place, the police station of Traiskirchen, near the initial reception centre. Unaccompanied children that are between 14 and 17 years old can further lodge their application at a designated police office in Schwechat. Unaccompanied children have no legal capacity to act by themselves in the procedure; nevertheless, they have the duty to cooperate during the procedure just as adults. Legal representatives have to be present both at interviews organised by the BFA and hearings at the BVwG. [2]

During the admissibility procedure, the legal advisers (who are contracted by the Ministry of Interior) act as legal representatives of the unaccompanied asylum-seeking child. There is no legal guardian appointed as the Child and Youth Welfare Authority denies its responsibility arguing that during the admissibility procedure it is not clear whether the children have a perspective to stay in Austria. UAM are not able to act without the consent of their legal adviser, for example to choose a legal representative by themselves or to submit an appeal in case the legal adviser fails to do so. Legal advisers were either from Verein Menschenrechte Österreich or from ARGE Rechtsberatung up until 2020. By taking over legal assistance, the BBU GmbH also took over the responsibility of legal representation of unaccompanied children in January 2021. According to the Human Rights Board (Menschenrechtsbeirat),[3] the fact that these legal advisers are only responsible for the asylum procedure and do not have full custody of the child is problematic. Furthermore, legal advisers are not required to have special expertise on children. The problem still lacks a solution and has become a part of public debate throughout 2020. An answer to a parliamentary request showed that more than 50% of unaccompanied minors disappear after lodging an asylum application. The Federal Youth Association (Bundesjugendvertretung) criticised the fact that no one has full custody over the children during the admissibility procedure and called for a solution that would foresee that full custody is assigned to a legal representative from the first day of the asylum procedure.[4]

With the takeover of the BBU GmbH in charge of providing legal counselling since January 2021 (see Legal assistance), no major changes concerning guardianship of unaccompanied minors have occurred. There is still no general appointed guardian in the admissibility procedure. The BBU GmbH is only responsible for legal representation in asylum procedures, all other areas of best interest of the child are not covered. The improvement of the protection and legal status of refugee children is set as an objective in the 2020-2024 coalition programme. Measures securing a swift access to childcare for unaccompanied minor refugees is foreseen and the child’s welfare is meant to be taken into consideration during the asylum procedure.[5] NGOs, and UNHCR, IOM and UNICEF have urged the government to take measures without delay to implement a better protection.[6] In 2022, the government has not yet presented a draft for a possible new guardianship law even though the pressure has increased following the report of the Kindeswohlkommission, an independent commission appointed by the Ministry of Justice following deportations of children in January.[7] The opposition parties have brought forward a parliamentary motion urging the federal government to further improve the protection and legal status of child refugees and to pay special attention to the best interests of the child.[8] The situation of unaccompanied minors got worse during the reception crisis in fall 2022: As the provinces failed to take over asylum seekers from the federal reception centres the centres’ capacity reached its limits. This resulted in up to 1,000 UAM having to stay in inadequate reception centres for months.

In 2023, 4,946 UAM (2022: 13,151) applied for asylum but 4,715 (2022: 11,629) absconded from the procedure.[9] This represents 95,3% (2022: 88,4%) of all applications by UAMs in 2023.[10]

In the case of siblings, the BFA and BVwG have assumed that an adult sibling has the power to represent their underage sibling in the admissibility procedure. The VwGH and VfGH have clarified, however, that legal representation during this procedure is a task for a legal adviser and cannot be performed by a sibling. The transfer of custody requires a court decision and cannot be based on the sole decision of the Child and Youth Service.[11]

After admission to the regular procedure and transfer to one of the federal provinces, the Child and Youth Service (KJH Kinder- und Jugendhilfe) takes over the legal representation according to the Asylum Act or by court decision.

Legal representation services are provided by the KJH in three federal states (Vienna, Lower Austria, Tyrol). NGOs provide legal services in other federal states, (Carinthia, Styria, Vorarlberg) and the legal representation is divided between different NGOs in the three remaining states (Upper Austria, Salzburg, Burgenland). UNHCR conducted a survey and concluded that there was no difference in the quality of the legal representation services provided by the different NGO’s.[12]

The quality of the assistance provided has been considered to be problematic in practice in some provinces  as well. NGOs report that in some cases the legal representative refrained from lodging an appeal, thereby disregarding the best interests of the child.[13] NGOs further reported to asylkoordination that, in cases where subsidiary protection was granted, the legal guardians appointed by the authorities refrained to consent to lodging an appeal against the negative asylum decision.[14]

Providing advice in return cases is mandatory since 2016 and unaccompanied children are also advised on return to their country of origin. Legal representatives are not informed about this, as a file note is only available when the application for voluntary return has already been signed. In 2017, 21 children, originating from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, returned voluntarily. In 2018, IOM, provided support to 10 unaccompanied minors for their voluntary return.[15] In 2019, 61 unaccompanied minors left the country voluntarily, including in the context of Dublin procedures, and two unaccompanied children were deported to Nigeria and Serbia respectively.[16] In 2020, there was no deportation of unaccompanied minors.[17] At the same time, IOM provided support to three unaccompanied minors for their voluntary return to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Russian federation.

Unaccompanied children also have the duty to cooperate with family tracing in the country of origin or third countries, regardless of the organisation or person who is undertaking the tracing. Children searching for family members can contact the Red Cross.

The number of unaccompanied children seeking asylum in Austria steadily decreased from 8,277 in 2015 to 4,551 in 2016, 1,751 in 2017 and 488 in 2018. After however, an increase in the number of applications for international protection by unaccompanied children was noted, reaching 859 applications in 2019.[18] In 2020, 1,467 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum, mainly from Afghanistan (825), Syria (389) and Morocco (34). 2021 was marked by another significant increase with 5,605 unaccompanied children, mainly from Afghanistan (3,363) and Syria (1,435). In 2022, a record number of 13,276 UAM applied for asylum in Austria. At the end of 2022, however, an alarming number of 11,613 persons absconded from the procedure.[19]

A reply to a parliamentary request from December 2019 indicated that only 170 cases of unaccompanied minors were admitted to the asylum procedure as minors. In 471 cases, the procedure was declared discontinued. Procedures are declared discontinued when the applicants leave the country voluntarily or have absconding from the procedure. Asylkoordination Österreich publicly criticised the authorities for losing track of these children and for not taking effective measures to protect underaged asylum applicants. This stands in direct connection with the refusal of the responsible KJH in the district of the initial reception centre of Baden to take over custody of unaccompanied minors during the admission procedure.[20] The Ministry of Interior argued that Child and Youth Service is responsible for the guardianship of unaccompanied minors while the Provence of Lower Austria (which is the supreme authority of the Child and Youth Service of Baden) stated that they can only take over responsibility for guardianship in emergency cases.[21]

In 2021, a total of 3,778 final decisions involving accompanied minor asylum seekers were issued, out of which 3,104 granted asylum (i.e. the large majority of 3,097 at first instance) and 266 granted subsidiary protection (all of them at first instance). In 2021, six residence permits were issued.[22] In 2021, around 4,500 unaccompanied minors disappeared after applying for international protection in Austria.[23] In 2023, 4,946 UAM (2022: 13,276) applied for international protection of which 4,715 (2022: 11,613) absconded, mostly within the first week after the application was lodged, NGOs and BBU GmbH reported to asylkoordination.

E. Subsequent applications
----
SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS IN Austria(E):
The AsylG defines subsequent applications as further applications after a final decision was taken on a previous asylum application.[1] If a further application is submitted while an appeal is still pending, the new application is considered as an addition to the appeal. Different legal safeguards apply depending on the previous procedure (in-merit or Dublin procedure) and the time of submitting the application. Usually, a subsequent application is not admitted to the regular procedure and is rejected as inadmissible.[2]

The Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) can either refuse the appeal rejecting the subsequent application as inadmissible or decide to revert it back to the BFA with the binding instruction to examine the subsequent asylum application either in a regular procedure or by conducting more detailed investigations.

An interview has to take place within the admissibility procedure, except in the case where the previous asylum application was rejected due to the responsibility of another Member State. Such interviews are shorter than in the first application and focus on changed circumstances or new grounds for the application. The law does not define new elements, but there are several judgments of the Administrative High Court that are used as guidance for assessing new elements.[3]

Reduced legal safeguards apply in case an inadmissibility decision was taken within the previous 18 months (i.e. if the rejection is connected to an expulsion order and a re-entry ban of 18 months). In this case, there is generally no suspensive effect for the appeal nor for the application itself. In many cases the asylum applicant does not even undergo a personal interview except for the preliminary interrogation conducted by the police.[4]

Suspensive effect against the expulsion order may be granted for an application following a rejection of the application on the merits or a safe third country decision, if the execution of the expulsion order of the previous asylum procedure could violate the non-refoulement principle. If suspensive effect is not granted, the file has to be forwarded to the BVwG for review and the Court has to decide within 8 weeks on the lawfulness of the decision.[5] The expulsion may be enforced 3 days after the Court has received the file.

Asylum seekers sent back to Austria by other Member States two years after their file has been closed due to their absence have to submit a subsequent application as well. The same applies to cases in which the decision has become final while the asylum seeker was staying in another Member State.

There is no limit on the number of subsequent applications that can be submitted. Different rules apply to subsequent applications with regard to suspensive effect of the application, which depends on whether the expulsion order will be executed within the following 18 days or whether the date is not yet fixed. In cases of rejection of subsequent asylum applications, the same rules regarding free legal assistance during the regular procedure apply: the BFA assigns the responsibility to one of the organisations (either VMÖ or ARGE) to appeal the negative decision.

Asylum seekers who submit a subsequent application within 6 months after the previous application has been rejected are not entitled to Basic Care provisions; nevertheless they may receive Basic Care during the admissibility procedure of the subsequent application (see section on Reception Conditions: Criteria and Restrictions to Access Reception Conditions).[6] If Basic Care is not granted, detention or a less coercive measure such as a designated place of living and reporting duties is ordered.[7]

In 2023, 5% (2022: 2.2%) of all applications came from subsequent applicants.

# Safe country of origin
----
SAFE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IN Austria(F):

Article 19 BFA-VG provides for a list of safe countries of origin. The Governmental order listing safe countries of origin must take into account primarily the existence or absence of state persecution, protection from persecution by non-state actors and legal protection against human rights violations. The COI department of the BFA has to take various state and non-state sources into account, e.g. reports from human rights bodies, media articles, governmental reports etc. The COI department’s methodology in this regard is accessible online.[1]

In asylum cases relating to applicants originating from a safe country of origin, the BFA can withdraw suspensive effect of the appeal in case of a negative decision.[2] The Federal Government may issue a decree ordering that the suspensive effect of an appeal against a negative decision must not be withdrawn, which is binding both for the BFA and the Courts.[3] The examination of the list of safe countries of origin by the Ministry of Interior is also based on previous COI reports produced by the (former) Federal Asylum Agency.

This list of article 19 BFA-VG includes all EU Member States,[4] although there is a mechanism that allows to take Member States off the list in case Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) is applicable; i.e. Article 7 TEU provides for suspension of certain rights deriving from the application of the Treaties in case of serious breach of the values on which the EU is based, as laid down in Article 2 TEU. As a consequence, suspensive effect must be granted for appeals in asylum procedures of nationals of these EU Member States. Other safe countries of origin mentioned in the Asylum Act are: Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, Australia and Canada. In 2023, 24 (2022: 26) EU-nationals originating from 10 Member States applied for asylum in Austria.[5]

Further states are defined as safe countries of origin by Governmental order (Herkunftsstaaten-Verordnung, HStV). As of December 2023, the list was last amended in March 2022, and included the following states:[6]

Albania;
Bosnia-Herzegovina;
The Republic of North Macedonia;
Serbia;
Montenegro;
Kosovo;
Benin;
Mongolia;
Morocco;
Algeria;
Tunisia;
Georgia;
Armenia;
Ghana;
Senegal;
Namibia;
South Korea;
Uruguay
The 2019 amendment took Sri Lanka, which had been added in June 2018,[7] off the list.[8] In March 2022, Ukraine was taken off the list.[9]

The Accelerated Procedure is applied in cases where the safe country of origin concept is applicable, and the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) has to decide within 7 calendar days on the suspensive effect of appeals against negative decisions. In such procedures, asylum seekers have access to free legal assistance where applications are rejected. Legal advisers have to organise interpreters. As of 2021, the Federal Agency (BBU-GmbH) will be in charge of providing legal assistance in these cases, as already mentioned above. The procedure may be accelerated, but there are no exceptional time limits for deciding such applications.

In 2023 8,533 (2022: 22,520; 2021: 3,495) applications were submitted by applicants originating from 16 different “safe countries of origins”, which represents 14% (compared to 21% in 2022) of the total numbers of applications for international protection. The largest numbers of applications were lodged by the following nationalities: Morocco (6,948), Tunisia (437) and Georgia (367).[10]

# Safe third country
SAFE THIRD COUNTRY IN Austria(F):
Article 4 AsylG sets out the safe third country concept. If the concept is applied the application is processed and rejected as inadmissible (see Admissibility Procedure).

Article 12(2) BFA-VG also provides that, in case of rejection of the application as inadmissible according to the safe third country concept, the BFA has to add a translation of the relevant articles and a confirmation in the language of the third country that the application was not assessed in the merits and that an appeal has no suspensive effect.

If the person cannot be deported within 3 months for reasons unrelated to their conduct, the inadmissibility decision ceases to be valid.[1] There is no list of safe third countries.

 

Safety criteria
Protection in a safe third country is deemed to exist if a procedure for the granting of refugee status in accordance with the Refugee Convention is available to the person in a country where they are not exposed to persecution or serious harm, and the person is entitled to reside in that country during such procedure and has protection there against deportation to the country of origin, provided that the person is exposed to such risk in the country of origin.[2] There is a presumption that these requirements are met by countries that have ratified the Refugee Convention and established by law an asylum procedure incorporating the principles of that Convention, the ECHR and its Protocols Nos 6, 11 and 13.[3]

The conditions for the application of the safe third country concept have been clarified by the Constitutional Court and VwGH. The presumption of compliance with safety criteria through ratification of legal instruments was affirmed in 1998 by the Administrative High Court, which has ruled that asylum authorities must first and foremost assess the legal conditions in a third country.[4] However, the Constitutional Court has ruled that the formal criteria of ratification of the Refugee Convention, the declaration according Article 25 ECHR and the existence of an asylum law are not sufficient to establish safety in a third country, but the granting of protection in practice has to be taken into consideration. Asylum authorities have to be prepared to have up-to-date information of relevant organisations to be able to assess the factual situation.[5]

 

Connection criteria
According to the aforementioned Constitutional Court and VwGH rulings, asylum applications cannot simply be rejected based on the mere fact that the applicant transited through or stayed in a so-called safe third country. When assessing the security of third countries, it does not only depend on formal criteria such as whether the country has ratified the Geneva Refugee Convention, the submission of a declaration under Art 52 ECHR and the existence of an asylum legislation, but also of whether the protection is actually granted.[6]

# First country of asylum
----
FIRST COUNTRY OF ASYLUM IN Austria(F):
The concept of “first country of asylum” is established in Article 4a AsylG. An application will be rejected as inadmissible, if the applicant has found protection in an EEA country state or Switzerland and asylum or subsidiary protection status was granted.

A law amendment that entered into force on 1 September 2018 deleted the 3 months deadline for validity of the inadmissibility decision if the person cannot be deported. As a consequence, the inadmissibility decision does no longer cease to be valid and deportation can still be undertaken at a later date.

Rejections for existing protection in another EU state are also issued regularly by the BFA concerning countries, see Suspension of returns of beneficiaries of protection in another Member State.

In a case ruled by the Federal Administrative Court in 2015, the rejection of the application as inadmissible of a Chechen refugee who was registered in Azerbaijan as “person of concern” to UNHCR was considered as insufficient. The court did not adequately assess whether the status is similar to the status of a recognised refugee nor whether the protection from refoulement was ensured.[1]

As mentioned in Safe Third Country, inadmissibility may be ordered when a person has obtained status in another EU Member State.

G. Information for asylum seekers and access to NGOs and UNHCR
# Provision of information on the procedure
----
PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE IN Austria(G):
Asylum seekers must receive written information leaflets in a language they understand after lodging the application and prior to the first interview. These information sheets are also available on the website of the BFA in 12 different languages.[1] At the beginning of the interview, the applicant must be informed about their rights and obligations throughout the procedure.

The BFA has published a brochure about the asylum procedure on its website. This brochure is in German and English only and is aimed at the general public:[2]

The following information is available in 11 languages on the website of the BFA:

The “first information sheet” explains the first steps and possible outcomes in the admissibility procedure including mandatory or voluntary advice on return including information;
Information sheet on the duties and rights of asylum seekers;
Information for asylum seekers according the Eurodac Regulation;
A short written information regarding the Dublin III Regulation.
Several NGOs also provide information on the procedure on their respective websites, such as Diakonie, Caritas or asylkoordination. In December 2018, UNHCR published a brochure “to inform unaccompanied refugee children about their situation and their rights in the asylum system.[3] This brochure is available in German, English, Arabi, Dari, Pashtu, Somali.

Detailed written information in languages other than German and English about the different steps of the procedure and rules and obligations does not exist. As asylum legislation changes very often, it does not seem to be affordable for NGOs to have brochures or other written information in the various languages required.

Useful explanations of terminology for asylum seekers from the Russian Federation were developed by an NGO from the federal state of Styria in cooperation with the University of Graz.[4] UNHCR has also produced a brochure about the asylum procedure for unaccompanied child refugees. It is available in four languages (German, English, Pashtu, Dari).[5] The Refugee Law Clinic of Vienna, an association formed by students at the Law Department of the University Vienna, also provides answers to “frequently asked questions”, which are available online in German, English, Somali. Pashtu, Arabic and Farsi.[6]

Asylum seekers against whom an enforceable – but not yet final – expulsion order is issued shall be informed in an appropriate manner (i.e. through a leaflet in a language understandable to them, if available) that, for the notification of decisions in the asylum procedure, they can access legal assistance and that they are obliged to inform the authority of their place of residence and address, including outside Austria.[7]

The system of free legal advice should, at least, provide information and counselling during the mandatory consultation with the appointed legal adviser in case the BFA intends to reject the asylum application as inadmissible or dismiss it on the merits in the admissibility procedure. The BFA has to include information in its decision about the right to appeal in a language understandable to the applicant. Besides the mother tongue, this could be the lingua franca of a country. In the decision of the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG), reference shall also be made, in a language understandable to the asylum seeker, to the possibility of filing a complaint in front of the Administrative High Court (VwGH) and the Constitutional Court (VfGH).[8]

At every stage of the procedure, asylum seekers are informed about the possibility of support for voluntary return. In the waiting rooms of the initial reception centres, videos providing information on voluntary return are streamed.

The BFA can also order consultation with regard to return. This is systematically done when a return decision is issued. When an asylum seeker leaves the country in the context of voluntary repatriation to their country of origin, the asylum proceeding is filed as redundant.

# Access to NGOs and UNHCR
----
ACCESS TO NGOS AND UNHCR IN Austria(G):
According to the law, UNHCR has access to all facilities and is allowed to get in contact with asylum seekers.[1] NGOs have contracts in 7 out of 9 federal provinces for providing social counselling. and visit reception centres of the federal provinces regularly. In two federal provinces, Carinthia and Tyrol, the social advice is provided by the federal administration. NGOs that do not fall under such contracts must file an application at the responsible office of the federal province in order to be granted access and visit asylum seekers. Access to detention facilities, including airport facilities, is difficult for NGOs in so far as they can only access if they already have some basic identification information on detained applicants, such as a name and date of birth.[2] The state agency BBU that provides legal counselling is bound by secrecy and is for this reason hindered from passing on information about clients to NGOs.

In 2019, restriction of freedom of movement of asylum seekers was not considered as a major problem by NGOs to get in contact and provide assistance to asylum seekers, as long as they also received care by the federal province. However, NGOs noticed that fines had been imposed and those having received a final rejection of their asylum application were ordered to live in the return centre Fieberbrunn, which is located in a very remote area. Moreover, access of NGOs to the centre in Schwechat Airport was not allowed and did not provide a suitable room for private consultations.

The situation in the return centres of Fieberbrunn (Tyrol) and Schwechat (Lower Austria) attracted public interest in 2019 as several rejected asylum seekers in Fieberbrunn initiated a hunger strike. A commission, composed of external experts and UNHCR, evaluated the situation in return centres in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior, especially in Fieberbrunn. An investigation was conducted and recommendations were published. The Ministry of Interior thus announced that it would follow the recommendations accordingly and monitor more closely the best interest of the child – meaning that, in the future, children should not be accommodated in Fieberbrunn and Schwechat but in another return centre which opened in Bad Kreuzen, Upper Austria, where they will be able to attend school. The Ministry also implemented more regular shuttle services per day from the Fieberbrunn centre to the village (as of 2019, there was only one shuttle per day).[3]

Officials of the BFA told representatives from the NGO asylkoordination that these recommendations do not have a binding character. Nevertheless, at the time of writing of this report, there were no children accommodated in Fieberbrunn and the shuttle service between the remote camp and the village has improved. This being said, reports to NGOs show that the access to medical treatment is still difficult. Following the establishment of the BBU GmbH which started providing legal assistance as of 2021, there were rumours that access for NGOs to return centres would be restricted in future. The BBU GmbH clarified however that Diakonie Flüchtlingsdienst will have access to the centre and will be provided with a room for counselling services. In 2022, due to the high number of applications and the failing cooperation of the provinces, the facilities in Fieberbrunn were not only used to accommodate persons whose Dublin procedures were pending but also other applicants due to the high number of new arrivals in 2022.[4]

Following the forced experience during covid lockdowns,[5] as a general point of view, the NGOs reported that providing counselling through remote technical means can work in practice but cannot replace or meet the same standards as face-to-face counselling in all circumstances.

H. Differential treatment of specific nationalities in the procedure
DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC NATIONALITIES IN THE PROCEDURE IN Austria(H):
“Fast-track”/accelerated procedures

The list of safe countries of origin, based on which the accelerated procedure may be applied, was expanded in 2019 to cover three new countries, namely Namibia, Uruguay and South Korea. On the contrary, Sri Lanka was deleted from the list.

The so-called “fast-track procedure” (see Fast-Track Processing), was initiated in 8,285 (2022: 32,875) cases in 2023, leading to 8,241 (2022: 23,297) decisions of which 300 (2022: 1,188) were decided in an accelerated procedure. In most of the fast track procedures, which mostly applies to persons from countries listed as safe countries of origin and manifestly ill-founded applications (in 2023 55% Morocco, 21% India)), a decision was taken within 72 hours in 2023.[1]

Afghanistan

The situation of Afghan asylum seekers changed considerably in 2021: Austria hosts one of the largest Afghan diaspora communities in Europe. At the start of the year, recognition rates concerning subsidiary protection were decreasing compared to previous years. In June 2021, the death of a 13-year-old girl that had been raped several times (the Causa Leonie case) initiated a public debate as the alleged perpetrators were Afghan nationals who were asylum seekers or who had previously applied for asylum. This led the public to urge authorities to carry out an increased and faster number of removals of rejected asylum seekers with a criminal record, thereby contributing to the anti-Afghan-narrative.

After the fall of Kabul and the takeover by the Taliban in summer 2021, the situation changed. Even though Austria was one of the last countries to stop deportations to Afghanistan, the Ministry of Interior continued to state in public that Austria would resume deportations to Afghanistan as soon as possible. Starting from August 2021, the number of discontinued cases of Afghan nationals thus started to rise as they moved on to other countries. This is also closely linked to the Anti-Afghan-propaganda of the Ministry of Interior in the context of the Causa Leonie case.

2021 was further marked by a rise of subsequent applications lodged by Afghans from 266 in 2020 to 633 in 2021, but these were not prioritised by the BFA.[2] After an important ruling by the Constitutional court in September 2021, the general decision making at first instance changed and now mostly includes granting subsidiary protection to Afghans.[3] Return decisions were issued by a small group of BVwG judges between September and December 2021, but they were halted by another landmark ruling by the Constitutional Court stating that this would breach Art 3 ECHR.[4] Since then, all decisions involving Afghan nationals have been granting protection. In 2022 and 2023, return decisions were issued in single cases but no deportations to Afghanistan took place or were planned. In September 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court referred a case concerning an Afghan woman to the CJEU for guidance on two questions relating to Art 9 of the Qualification Directive: Firstly, whether a combination of measures adopted, encouraged or tolerated by a state which limit a women’s freedom could amount to persecution within the meaning of Article 9(1)(b) of the Qualification Directive (recast) and secondly, whether a woman who is affected by such measures taken by the state should be granted refugee status solely on the basis of her sex or if it would be necessary to examine the individual circumstances of the applicant to determine how the measures impact a woman’s individual situation.[5] The opinion of the Advocate General concluded that a combination of measures could amount to persecution per the Qualification Directive when those have the cumulative effect of depriving those women and girls of their most basic rights in society and thus undermine full respect for human dignity, and that the authorities could consider there was a well-founded fear of being subjected to such acts of persecution on account of gender, without having to look for other factors particular to the person’s personal circumstances.[6]

Palestine

Regarding applicants coming from Gaza, the BFA introduced new questions in the first interview conducted by the police. The applicants were questioned how they view the conflict between Gaza and Israel and what their position towards Israel is. These questions have led to several complaints brought in by affected applicants before courts based on discriminatory grounds. The procedures are pending at the time of writing.[7]
