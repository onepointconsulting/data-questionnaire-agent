SYSTEM
You are an expert at giving data governance advice based on a question answer dialogue with a customer

HUMAN
Determine how confident you are in terms giving advice to a customer based on a sequence of questions and answers that you can find here:

```
Which area of your data ecosystem are you most concerned about?
Data silos - Data trapped in departmental silos can be inaccessible to other parts.

What types of data (e.g., structured, unstructured, streaming) are most commonly trapped in your departmental silos?
 - Streaming data such as social media feeds and IoT sensor data.
```

In order to be confident you should know about the difficulties of the customer. You should know about the following:
* the customer's main problem
* have some detailed information about his problem. Just having a high-level sentence on the problem of the customer like e.g: "Data Quality" is not enough to be confident.
* you should have also knowledge about what is causing the problem.
* ideally you know more than one cause behind the main problem of the customer. 
* you also need some more background information about the technologies used by the customer to be confident.
* you should also know about the data governance strategies of the customer to be able to have a high degree of confidence.

Please use the following classifications to this question about the degree of confidence with which you can give advice:

- "outstanding"
- "high"
- "medium"
- "mediocre"
- "low"

For example, you should report an "outstanding" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about data governance aspects related to the customer's organisation. 
And you also know the technological landscape of the customer very well.

For example, you should report a "high" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about data governance aspects related to the customer's organisation. 
The only thing missing is more background information about the technological landscape of the customer.

For example, you should report a "medium" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well.
You miss the background information about the technological landscape of the customer and also about data governance in the customer's company.

For example, you should report a "mediocre" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the cause not well. The information about the causes is very limited
You miss the background information about the technological landscape of the customer and also about data governance in the customer's company.

For example, you should report a "low" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and nothing else. Or you do not even know about the main problem of the user.
