# Questionnaire

Q: Which area of your data ecosystem are you most concerned about?
A: Cost and complexity - A robust data analytics infrastructure requires significant investment of resources.


Q: What specific challenges are you facing in managing the cost and complexity of your data analytics infrastructure?
A: We struggle with the high costs of data storage and processing.


Q: What strategies have you explored or implemented to manage the high costs associated with data storage and processing in your analytics infrastructure?
A: We are considering data compression techniques to manage storage expenses.
We have not yet implemented any specific strategies, as we are still in the research phase.


Q: What types of data are you primarily dealing with in your analytics infrastructure, and how does this impact your storage and processing costs?
A: Our infrastructure handles a lot of unstructured data, leading to increased storage costs due to its volume and complexity.


Q: How do you prioritise your data governance initiatives within the organisation, especially when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data?
A: We focus on data quality and security as top priorities to ensure compliance and reliability.


Q: What methods or technologies are you currently using to handle and process unstructured data, and how effective have they been in managing costs and complexity?
A: We have implemented data lakes to store unstructured data, but managing them has proven complex.


# Recommendations

- **Implement data compression techniques** to reduce storage expenses. Given the high costs associated with storing unstructured data, employing data compression can significantly decrease the amount of space required, thereby lowering costs.
- **Leverage a Modern Data Strategy** to handle unstructured data more effectively. This strategy can help consolidate unstructured data on a data lake, making it easier to manage and potentially reducing costs.
- **Utilise data lakehouse architecture** to simplify data management and reduce complexity. By integrating the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses, a data lakehouse can provide a more streamlined approach to managing data, which can help in handling large volumes of unstructured data.
- **Adopt DataOps practices** to enhance data processing efficiency. DataOps can streamline workflows and improve the speed and quality of data analytics, helping to manage the complexity and costs of your data infrastructure.
- **Invest in active metadata management** to improve data governance. This can help in maintaining data quality and security, particularly for unstructured data, ensuring compliance and reliability.

# What to avoid

- Avoid neglecting the importance of metadata management, as it is crucial for maintaining data quality and governance.
- Do not overlook the potential of a Modern Data Strategy to manage unstructured data effectively, as this can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs.
- Avoid relying solely on traditional data warehouses for unstructured data, as they may not be cost-effective or efficient for managing such data types.

# Positive outcomes

- Reduced storage costs through effective data compression and management strategies.
- Enhanced data governance and quality, leading to improved compliance and reliability.
- Streamlined data management processes that reduce complexity and improve efficiency.
