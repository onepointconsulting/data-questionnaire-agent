# Recommendations

- **Invest in Data Quality Training**: As your organisation is facing issues with incomplete or outdated data, it's vital to provide comprehensive data quality training to your staff. This will equip them with the necessary skills to identify and rectify data quality issues proactively, reducing the reliance on manual reviews.
- **Establish Formal Data Governance Policies**: Since you are planning to create a dedicated data governance team, it is crucial to establish clear data governance policies. These should define roles, responsibilities, and processes for data management, ensuring a consistent approach to data governance across the organisation.
- **Implement Automated Data Integrity Checks**: To address the lack of formal processes for ensuring data integrity, consider implementing automated data integrity checks. This will help maintain data consistency and reliability across different systems and stages of the data lifecycle, reducing the dependency on manual checks.
- **Utilise Data Cleansing Tools**: Given your challenges with incomplete or outdated data, employing data cleansing tools can be beneficial. These tools can automate the process of identifying and correcting data issues, ensuring that the data remains accurate and up-to-date.
- **Regularly Update Data Documentation**: Assign dedicated personnel to maintain and update data documentation regularly. This will help keep your documentation current amidst rapid changes, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to accurate and up-to-date information about data sources and processes.

# What to avoid

- **Avoid Relying Solely on Manual Checks**: Manual checks for data integrity and quality are time-consuming and prone to human error. Relying solely on them can lead to inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
- **Do Not Delay the Formation of a Data Governance Team**: Procrastinating on establishing a data governance team will only prolong the issues related to data management and governance. Swift action is necessary to address these challenges effectively.
- **Avoid Neglecting Data Documentation**: Inadequate or outdated documentation can lead to misunderstandings and errors. Ensure that documentation is not neglected and is regularly updated to reflect any changes in data systems.

# Positive outcomes

- **Improved Data Quality and Accuracy**: By investing in training and automated tools, the quality and accuracy of your data will improve, leading to more reliable decision-making.
- **Enhanced Data Governance**: Establishing a dedicated team and clear policies will streamline data management processes, ensuring better governance and compliance.
- **Increased Operational Efficiency**: Automated processes for data integrity checks and cleansing will reduce the time and effort required for manual interventions, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
