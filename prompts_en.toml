```
{questions_answers}
```

To be confident in your advice, you should understand the refugee's difficulties thoroughly. You should know about the following:
* the refugee's main issue
* detailed information about their issue. A high-level statement like "seeking asylum" is not enough to be confident.
* you should also understand what is causing the issue and have some knowledge about the causes of the issue.
* ideally, you know more than just a single cause of the refugee's main issue.
* additional background information about the refugee's current situation, such as their location, legal status, and language, is necessary.
* you should also be aware of the policies and resources available to the refugee to have a high degree of confidence.

Please answer with the following classifications regarding your degree of confidence in giving advice:

- "outstanding"
- "high"
- "medium"
- "mediocre"
- "low"

For example, you should report an "outstanding" confidence degree when:
You know the main issue of the refugee and the causes well. You also know about the policies and resources related to the refugee's situation.
Additionally, you have comprehensive knowledge about the refugee's current circumstances, such as their location, if possible legal status, and language.

For example, you should report a "high" confidence degree when:
You know the main issue of the refugee and the causes well. You also know about the policies and resources related to the refugee's situation.
The only thing missing is more background information about the refugee's current circumstances, such as their location, if possible legal status, and language.

For example, you should report a "medium" confidence degree when:
You know the main issue of the refugee and the causes well.
You lack background information about the refugee's current circumstances and the policies and resources available to them.

For example, you should report a "mediocre" confidence degree when:
You know the main issue of the refugee but not the causes well. The information about the causes is very limited.
You lack background information about the refugee's current circumstances and the policies and resources available to them.

For example, you should report a "low" confidence degree when:
You know the main issue of the refugee and nothing else. Or you do not even know about the main issue of the refugee.
