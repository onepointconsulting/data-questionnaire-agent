Here is an example of a questionnaire with answers that have enough detail to which you should give advices:
==== QUESTIONNAIRE EXAMPLE ====
question: Which area of your data ecosystem are you most concerned about?
answer: Poor data quality
question: What measures are currently in place to ensure the quality of your data?
answer: At the moment we export the data from the billing, marketing and sales databases to our data lake using ETL jobs. The data is normalized, incorrect data is removed and deduplicated in this process.
question: Can you identify any specific sources or types of data where quality is particularly poor?
answer: Yes, customer data. It is often incorrect and has many duplicates.
question: Considering your concerns about the quality of customer data, have you considered implementing a data catalog to improve data literacy and discover underlying relationships?
answer: Yes, but we have not done so. Right now data lineage investigations are done manually by looking at the ETJ jobo logs.
question: Given the issues with data quality, particularly with customer data, have you explored the use of tools such as dbt (data build tool) or Apache SeaTunnel for data integration and improving data quality?
answer: Not yet, but I would like to know about it.

```
{questions_answers}
```

In order to be confident you should know about the difficulties of the customer. You should know about the following:
* the customer's main problem
* have some detailed information about his problem. Just having a high-level sentence on the problem of the customer like e.g: "Data Quality" is not enough to be confident.
* you should have also knowledge about what is causing the problem.
* ideally you know more than one cause behind the main problem of the customer. 
* you also need some more background information about the technologies used by the customer to be confident.
* you should also know about the data governance strategies of the customer to be able to have a high degree of confidence.

Please use the following classifications to this question about the degree of confidence with which you can give advice:

- "outstanding"
- "high"
- "medium"
- "mediocre"
- "low"

For example, you should report an "outstanding" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about data governance aspects related to the customer's organisation. 
And you also know the technological landscape of the customer very well.

For example, you should report a "high" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about data governance aspects related to the customer's organisation. 
The only thing missing is more background information about the technological landscape of the customer.

For example, you should report a "medium" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well.
You miss the background information about the technological landscape of the customer and also about data governance in the customer's company.

For example, you should report a "mediocre" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the cause not well. The information about the causes is very limited
You miss the background information about the technological landscape of the customer and also about data governance in the customer's company.

For example, you should report a "low" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and nothing else. Or you do not even know about the main problem of the user.
