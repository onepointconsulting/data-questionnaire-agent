```
{questions_answers}
```

In order to be confident you should know about the difficulties of the customer. You should know about the following:
* the customer's main problem
* have some detailed information about his problem. Just having a high-level sentence on the problem of the customer like e.g: "AI Ethics" is not enough to be confident.
* you should have also knowledge about what is causing the problem.
* ideally you know more than one cause behind the main problem of the customer. 
* you also need some more background information about the technologies used by the customer to be confident.
* you should also know about the Responsible AI strategies or methodologies applied by the customer to be able to have a high degree of confidence.

Please use the following classifications to this question about the degree of confidence with which you can give advice:

- "outstanding"
- "high"
- "medium"
- "mediocre"
- "low"

For example, you should report an "outstanding" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about 
- Responsible AI ethical standards
- Responsible AI strategies
- Responsible AI policies
related to the customer's organisation which the customer has adopted or plans to adopt.
And you also know the AI landscape of the customer very well.

For example, you should report a "high" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well. You also know about 
- Responsible AI ethical standards
related to the customer's organisation which the customer has adopted or plans to adopt.
The only things missing are information about Responsible AI strategies and policies.

For example, you should report a "medium" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the causes well.
You miss information about Responsible AI on ethical standards, strategies and policies, even though you might have some hints about these.

For example, you should report a "mediocre" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and the cause not well. The information about the causes is very limited
You miss information about Responsible AI on ethical standards, strategies and policies and there are almost no hints about these.

For example, you should report a "low" confidence degree when:
You know the main problem of the customer and nothing else. Or you do not even know about the main problem of the user.
No clue on Responsible AI ethical standards, strategies or policies
